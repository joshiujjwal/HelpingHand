What is up guys, this is MisterNinjaBoyAnd today I'm going to start a new series, guiding you guys through Photoshop;Starting from the very basics and essentials,To eventually getting into the more advanced stuff in graphic design.My goal here is to maintain simplicity in this series,and to make it possible for literally anyone to learn to use Photoshop.Even if you've just started, and are already confused, just looking at the interface.Don't worryI can understand it may be daunting the first time you open Photoshop,with all these options. In fact it can be intimidating at first starting with any new program.But my goal here is to show you guys how simple yet Powerful Photoshop really is.The sky is truly the limit with what you can do with it.If you guys don't know, this channel isn't only focused on gaming.In fact, I've Started it with tutorials on game development.By the way, you can check that out on the channel if you want to.But I've always really enjoyed teaching you guys my tips and tricks, and passing on my knowledgeI got in certain programs, to newcomers and to people looking to improve.So I'm quite excited to start this series.Later on, we're going to be doing some really exciting stuff, like making thumbnails, making logos,Complex graphic art, and much more.But in this first tutorial, we're just going to focus on the very basics of Photoshop.This is the perfect guide for someone who has just begun using Photoshop.So like any program the best way tofamiliarize yourself to it at first would be to get a hang of the interface and all its features.So we're going to do just that. Then as we dive deeper into this tutorialI'm going to show you guys a collection of simple yet essential features that you must learn while first starting.Alright, so let's get started.Alright, so let's get started with learning the interface.Now, to make sure that we're all on the same page with theInterface itself with all its features all the windows, everything,Let's go to Window > WorkspaceAnd then make sure you're checked on 'Essentials Default' which is basically going to ensure that we have all the same features and everything.Alright, so now let's proceed to make our first file, our first project you can call it.So let's go to File > NewAnd then this is basicallyThe window where we're going to do all the settings for our project. So first of all we can name the project whatever we want.I'm just going to name it 'example' for the tutorial's sake. And then,For the width and height,You can later on you can do whatever you want mattering on what what sort of project you want. Let's say you want to dolike a Twitter header or something then there's certain,Dimensions you want to do then you choose that. But for now, we're going to do a standard 1920 x 1080dimension for this project.And then make sure you're always selected on pixels. This is important,So for the width and height you want to be on both on the same units essentially.But we're going to be working with pixels because it's the easiest. I mean I don't really work with centimeters or millimeters inchesOn the computer itJust doesn't make sense for me, but I mean I guess it matters on what you're doing, but for me pixels, for nowWe're just we're going to work with pixels for both width and height.And yeah, I was going to say for me. It's just the easiest because you know everything is in pixels on the computer, soYeah, so the just select everything here. It doesn't really matter if you what you do for the[bit-depth], [I'm] just going to go 16-bit and yeah that's - that's pretty much it[so] let's press continue, or okay.And then we continue to this screen which gives us the by default we're just going to have a blank white squareSo this is as you guys can see um right here [to] the rightThis is basically like the layers tab this this shows us all the layers all the elements everything that is included in the projectSo all we have now this is basically like a very blank project with all we have is thisBackground on white box sort of thing so um to first get started and we're just gonna unlock this layer because by defaultwhen you make a new projectThe first layer [is] locked so we don't really have a lot of freedom to do like move it around and stuffSo what we're gonnaDo is actually double click on this lockedIcon or this lock icon and then when we do that as you guys can see we have this layer optionso let's name it, background. So...Let's name it background and then, we can keep the color, we can do it none [select]and then it'll basically be default color or we can choose whatever you want and that will essentially just make the color of theNot essentially the box, but that that's like the color here. Here, Let me do that. Let's select the colorThis is this is actually very good for organizing, and then we're going to go over that later.So let's as you guys can see the red color that we selected is sort of kind of like [marks] it with that little red color.So later on, while you're working you can alwaysAssign layers different colors and with that you can kind of organize your project, but that's not very important for nowwe're [just] going to learn the interface for now so as you guys can see we have a white background here, soThe first thing we're actually going to do is learn the move tool. So the first tool [that] we are [actually] offered in thisColumn to the [left] is this move tool. So we're going to select make sure that you go to the right in this layersTab and select our only one and only layer in this projectAnd then we're going to select the move tooland then we can as you guys can see we can move the box around andWhat you've seen this background if you see this like sort of checkeredBackground that basically means it's it's transparent because if you if you render out this picture right now, it's basically going to be transparentSo all you'd see is this box and then nothing else. This background is transparent . So what we're gonna actually do isUndo that so you can undo move and then let's say you do a coupleActions the best way to undo stuff is to actually go CTRL+Alt+ZBecause that is ultimately, like you can only undo once. As you guys can see I un-did all the way back tocreating the background so let's actually re-step forward. So if I do CTRL+Z,let's uh Let's add likeJust just for the tutorials sakeLet's just do like Scribbles something like that.So let's say I did CTRL+Z once and then I did it again as you guys can see it justRe-did that so the way we goStep backwards if you want to keep on undoing more than once is CTRL+alt+z or we can go onEdit > Step backward. That's a very important tool you guys must know in the future.anyways, so now let's add aShape to this project. As you guys can see that is like we learned to use the [move] toolwhich is you know it's... quite straightforward, and then..We're going to learn to do more stuff like rotating. So the first thingWe're actually going to do now to learn that is actually go down to thisThis tool right got you as you guys can see it's like a little squiggly sort of shapeso we're going to right click on that and actually select the rectangle [tool], soAs you guys can see we can cut we kind of have this little crosshair sort of thing[so] [we're] going to select and drag and we're going to make arectangle by doing that soWe did make a rectangle, but as you guys can see it's sort of like a a white rectangleSo it's kind of blending in the background all us can see is like the black outline around it kind of indicating that we're selectedOn it so if we deselect that as you guys can see we can't really see the rectangleSo we're gonna we're going to assign a color to it or a fill colorSo we're just going to go to the fill option as you guys can see up hereSelect that and we can choose any color for the rectangle since the background is whiteAnything that isn't white is it's going to show so let's just make thisLike a dark [grey] color. I guess that works so now if you want tomove theRectangle in the middle of course we can do that by just clicking dragging and if you guys want to move any objectUm in a sort of linear fashion where you don't really?If you want to just like a sign like a certain let's say we want to move it um like horizontallySo we can just like put it there and then if you just hold down shiftAnd then move it it sort of locks to the position where it was if let's say, we're moving horizontally nowWe can't move it left and rightWe can just move it horizontally because it's locked and then let's say we want to move it left and right thereSo it that's how that's the way you and then let's say. We like of shift as you guys can see it[just] it does that so we can also do that diagonally of course so um that's the way you guys you guys can move thingsLinearly where it kind of just locks on to the axisIt's on so now let's say we wanted to rotate this rectangle. We can go ctRl t. And that is basically just[or]basically the the shortcut for the transform andLet's say we wanted to rotate this rectangle. We can we can guide our mouse to the sort of corner ofThe box where we kind of see this little arrow?pointing downward and then to the left andOnce we see [that]We can click and drag to how we want to rotate thisSo let's say we want to rotate it like that or like that and you can all you if you guysAlso can see like this angle sort of thing up here. We can do thatNumerically we can um we don't [necessarily] need [to] do it visually hereBut we can also input numbers and do whatever you want with the anglesSame with the width and width and height on all the dimensionsSo let's say we wanted to reset that to zero just to you know have a have it like how it was beforewe did anything any of the edits orAnother way you guys can do [that]. Let's say youYou've scaled it you did a bunch of stuff [to] the objectBut you didn't you want to just revert it to how it was before umBefore you went to control t. You guys can just click this sort oflikeUndo icon I guess and as you guys can see it kind of revert sit to what we did before the transform optionsSo um now what we're actually going to do is as you guys can see you guys can scale it visuallyAs I said or you can [actually] do it here, so let's say we want it twice as big as it [is] [now]So we can go 200% by 200%So it's basically two times bigger than it was and then once we [are] happy with what we do the editswe did we can just click this check arrow, and then or the check icon and then basically we've justApplied all the changes. We did to this object[all] right, so now we're gonna actually now. That's basically like the very basics of the interface andNow we're actually going to add some effects to this box like a drop shadow. Maybe an outer glow or something like thatand this is actually very simple to do soWe're just going to navigate down to area make sure you're selected on the certain layerSo if we selected on this it kind of shows like these little square icons where you can obviously do the changes and then you[can] do all the stuff that we learned so I'm just going to revert back to how it wasBut make sure you're selected on the rectangle on top and this is allvery important to actually know like theIt's kind of like a hierarchy so it let's say we wanted to have this background on top of thisWhere we wouldn't be able to see this we basically just have to drag that on top so any any layer that is on topisIs shown on top of it so it's basically like a layering system. It's very straightforward, soYeah, always make [sure] that the smaller layers this backgrounds are always on the bottom of everythingBut that's basically the way you want to think about itSo yeah, make sure this layer is on top of the background and then let's say we want to add like I said effectsSo we click on the rectangle and go down to [this] effect icon click on that and then go blending options?so now this is where we have a bunch of options where we can mess around with soThe first thing I'd like to do is to drop shadow. So have a little shadow on behind this boxSo we go down to this option and click on drop Shadow so as you guys can see um we have a little shadowBehind this box, but we can make it more [drastic] make it biggerSo we can increase we can like make it bigger by increasing the size and then the spread the spreadEssentially makes it more like condensedI want to say but I'm not sure if that's the right word to use, but um so basically yeahWe can increase it using the spread in size size, just makesMake it makes the shadow spread a bit moreSo let's make the size a bit smaller so as you guys can see we have a little shadowbehind [and] that looks pretty nice andwhat else can we do um for the effects we can add aStroke and the stroke is basically like a [little] outline that goes around any objectsSo the stroke we can change the color. Let's make it red for [example], and then we can press okAnd we can also increase the sizeOf the stroke by going by clicking dragging or so like in putting your own numberSo let's say we want it 10 pixels and as you guys can see that's the 10 pixel stroke that we have around thisrectangle now andWhat else can we do we can do a bevel and emboss as you guys can see it adds like [a] little nice 3Dsort of embossedBevel sort of effect and we can increase the depth and by doing so it gives that illusionEven more and then we can obviously increase the size and that that doesn't look very good. Let's make itYeah, that looks good all rightWhat else can we do we can also add a?Pattern overlay, and then you can mess with this add your own patterns and stuffBut these are the default patterns that come with photoshop. So this is a nice little texture sort of thingThat's that's a cool texture, but we can't really see it since the background is like white so yeahThose are basically like textures you can add so we're not going to really add anything for nowwe're just going to keep it like that or actually let's just add that texture like that looks pretty cool andWhat else [can] we do we can do an outer glow? So outer glow is basically?Let's add a different. Let's make it redSo it'll go nicely with the d border so or the stroke so the outer glow is essentially justJust like a drop Shadow sort of thing itIt's very similar to the shadow, but it's it basicallyIt's just like a little glow of a certain color that you can choose or that basically outlines around the objectYou can also do inner glow thatThat basically does the same effectbut towards the inside of the object instead of it having it on the outside of it, soWe can also do color overlayThis is where we can if it's not a shape, and we can edit the fill we can actually do itHere manually so we can go to color overlayAnd then we can change the color do it to whatever color we want choose whatever colorWe want and yeah, we're not going to do that now. So we're going to just uncheck thatSatin basically just makes it a little darker that looksbut that can be cool effect and also yes inner glow inner shadow the shadow is [based] inner shadows basically like aUp Shadow, but it makes it like in the inside of it same as inner glowIn comparison to outer glow, so the same sort of idea and a gradient overlayThis is a this is a cool feature that we can take a look at so gradient overlays essentially it kind of mixescolors intoinstead of having one solid color so as you guys can see this is [a] mixture of like a black and aGray /white ish color and there's a couple presets which we can choose is like a rainbowAnd there's there's like striped black. There's like there's cool colors, soThese are only the presets, but you guys can edit them so let's say we wanted that, and then we can edit itSo we can change the colors here, so we can actually select that and then we can select different colorsSo let's say we want in the middle color like green. We can have it red andYeah, so you can edit it to whatever you basically want so they're um let's sayWe're happy with that and then that's like gradient overlay, so it's basically like a mixture [of] colorsThat's a best way to think about it. I guessso um yeah, let's just keep it with that texture andSo yeah, those are basically like the effects the essential effects[they're] so easy to you know to use and it's very simple [and] to add everything and drop shadow all the strokes everything onThere very simple yet. They're used in like you know and inQuite complex graphics, I always use them these are very basic and they work really well, so they're awesome so umnow we're actually going to import eight an image from the [internet] that I downloaded andEdit that so the way we're going to do. This is actually going to go to file and then we're going to go to placeSo there's two ways we can do this we can go to file placeand then find the image that we downloaded so we're this is an image of the MCLAren P1 orLet's say we undid [that] and then we can go to file openAnd then we can open that and then that actually opens it to the exact dimensions of the image itselfAnd that's the way best way to do it if you want to edit a certain image instead of doing itInstead of placing it inside a projectbut let's say you have a project where you want to mix pictures in and add different pictures you can go to file place andthen find the image and then put but um yeahSo we're gonna basically do some edits to this to this imageSo the first thing we're going to do is actually duplicate this MCLAren P1So we're going to go to this tool right here. Which is called the lasso tool andAs you guys can see down [here]We have a little um this thing that [says] 50% is basically the how much it zoomed to the original sizeso let's [go] hundred percent, so that just this just means that we are looking [at] the exact resolution of this image andThe reason why we go [50%] when editing the full project isThat is so we can see the full project because if you go [over] 50%We'd have to scroll around to be able to see everything but for this for the lasso toolIt's very important to see every little detailSo we're Gonna go100% and if you guys have a smaller image that you want to edit then you'd [want] you [want] to go even biggerBut essentially for this we're just going to go 100% and once we're zoomed inwe're just going to have a nice shot of the MCLAren, soBasically just zoom [into] [a] point where the biggest part of the image isThe the focus where you want to duplicate?So now we're just going to outline this this McLaren P1 having selected this lasso tool. So we're going to outline itStarting from here, and we're going to do a bit [of] a sloppy job hereIt's not very important to be very precisebut um all you got to do is just click and drag with your left mouse button tool andJust select all the outer part of the image that youso yeahI'll leave this image in the description down below that you guys can edit the same exact thing that I'm [doing] but if you guysWanted to do a different image. Just find one on the internet anything really uh it doesn't really have to be carved, but umFor this tutorial is simple on a car. This this image is actually very good for like theDuplicating and everything that we're going to do so I'm just selecting it with this, lassoTool doesn't really have to be very precise if I was going to do this very preciseI'd probably go like like six hundred percent on the zoom and just do like very pixel-By-pixelMaking it really really sharpBut anyways now that we've done that [we] can zoom back out to look at the fullImage and go 50 percent and as you guys can see there we've selected that now before we duplicate itLet's do the same thing with this background and double click on this lock iconso once we do that [a] we can basically lay in the layer to whatever we want so let's name it, McLaren andThen once we've named it [maclaren's] press enter or click ok and then as you guys can see thereWe've got the imageUnlocked and the next thing to do is to make sure that you selected on that on that layerAnd then we're going to go control-C or command-Cmatters if you're on Mac [or] PCIt doesn't really matter, but yeahSo just cTRl CAnd then [cTRl] [V] so once we've done that as you guys can see now we have two layersAnd if we hide this layer, we can hide layers by clicking on this little eye iconWhich indicates layer visibility as it says there?so we click on that as you guys can see we have just an outline of the McLaren itself and then the background is justTransparent as I guess totally as I told you guys before on this checker sort of thing is indicates that the background is transparentSo let's just bring the background back, and now as you guys can see we have this McLaren here, so we can click inUsing the move tool that I showed you guys earlierWe can click and [drag] and move it to where wherever we want on this projectlet's say we want this McLaren facing this McLaren so sort of switching theThe Direction it's going so we can go cTRl twhich is short for transform the shortcut and we can go to height and just add a little minus symbol orNova that [makes] it [upside-down]. Let's let's do it on the wif actually so let's go [minus] a hundred [percent]Which it's still maintaining the samedimensions however, it'snegative on the width making it on the going to other direction, soWe can also do that by [clicking] and dragging like that, but the easiest way to maintain the proportions is to just do itlike that soonce we choose a spot where we[McLaren] we can press [okay] or we can even do the rotation like I showed you guys earlier?And that looks pretty cool. Just two little [maclaren's] on facing each other off, soWhat are we going to do now? We can do some effects. Let's say like a drop shadow andThat looks all rightLet's make it a little biggerwe can do outer glow that looks cool, and then we can increase the size as you guys can see [that] looks pretty cool, soYeah, I just showed you guys everything else [it]. You know. It's quite straightforward [um]for the effect, but now we're actually going to do is to actually make a adjustment layer andBasically we're going to mess around with the color Correction the exposureEverything to make this imageLook as nice as possible. So the way we're going to do this is we're going to go to layer and then newOr sorry no, we're going to go to layer new adjustment layerAnd then the first thing we're going to do is to add a brightness contrast layerSo we're just going to click ok you can name that whatever you want you can [even] color code itJust like I showed you guys earlier too for you know for better organizationbut we're just gonna leave that alone for now so um asYou guys can see this is the first adjustment layer now adjustment layers basically are just like editing layers. They're not visibleThey're not necessarily like solid itemsBut or objects in the scene or in the and you know in the project and the ou and all the elementsBut they're basically just - just the the visual aspect of this projectSo we're going to go to contrastWe're actually going to increase the contrast as you guess and see if we decrease the contrast it looks a lot more likewashed upOr um if we increase it it looks a lot more like like vivid so we're gonna make it let's say40 looks good [40] yeah, well that looks pretty goodAnd then we can increase the brightness a little decrease it that looks pretty nice if we decrease the brightness a bit thereToo much brightness doesn't look very good in my opinion um let's go actually - [7] I thought, I'd actually go more brightnessBut a little lower brightness looks a lot better. So now that looks that's how it looked before the firstAdjustment layer and then after that's how it looks, so it you knowBut as you guys can see it already looks pretty cool. Just like that. So we're gonna add [another] adjustment layer by going layernew adjustment layer and then we're going to go tolevelsnow we're just click [ok] just like everything else and thenLevels we can there's a lot of presets so you can mess [with] that yourself hereBut we're gonna actually select our preset on the level so you can click darkerWhoo that looks really coolAnd then there's increased contrast and you know so this is basically like a easy way toMake your project look a certain way, so let's just me let's select um let's see let's see[increased] contrast that's a little too much contrast one darker. That's a little too darkMid-Tones brighterMid-Tones Darker, I think that looks pretty damn cool andNow on since it's quite darkWe can actually go back to this and double click on that icon and increase the brightness a bit because it is quite dark[alright] that looks pretty cool now, [so]Next thing we're going to add is actually a let's see a layer and [then] new adjustment layer. We can add aLet's seeExposure and then once we add exposure you can mess around with that. We're actually [Gonna]Decrease the exposure a bit and then the offset you can mess [around] with thatand then we're actually going to increase that a bit just to bring out the color the dark color is a bit and then theGamma Correction you can mess around with that as wellThat is starting [to] look really cool. So that is how the project or like itIt's initially looked and then after all these correct Correction layersThis is how it's looking right nowSo let's add one more just for the sake of you know showing you guys how all this works?It's all the same you know, it's all the sameConcept you just have to tweak it and then play with all the settings everything just to get the perfect look of the project thatYou want so let's go to layer new Adjustment layerAnd then let's add a let's see color lookup now color lookups are arebasically like a correct in color layer andAnd these are quite tricky to work [with] because you can you can it you can basicallyLoad up files um that are called lut filesAnd I might actually do that later in like different tutorials and show you guys how to make thoselut different color um color Correction files[so]For now, we're gonna go with something that is default um that it looks pretty coolSo we're gonna go in let's see turquoise, sepiaBut as you guys can see these are basically like filters [um] that make your project look a certain way umLet's see that looks coolso um if we're happy with that we can just leave that on um yeah, so that's basically like theYou know all the adjustment layers alright, so let's say I wanted to add some text now to this projectIt's actually really straightforward in Photoshopthere's this icon with a t on it one of the tools andThat actually allows us to add text so let's actually select that and thenAnywhere on the project that we want to act actually I add the text box or the text itself?we can just click so let's say what we wanted to add a title here at the top so we can just click there andType something, so I'm just going to sayExample since this is a tutorial so as you can see we [just] typed a text thereBut um it's not visible because it's like half cut off because you know it's not positioned correctlyso if we if we just move like anywhereout of the actual text box itself you can still see the the move position before we click theCheck mark for the transform toolSo there as you can as you can see it says example, but it actually is quite big this textSo let's make it a bit smaller. Let's go to let's sayYou can change the the [font] and everything from herelet's say we wanted to change the font so it's about some select something else andThat [one's] that's not really nice font there we gothat's a pretty good font and then um we also need to tone [down] the the actual the thefont size, soHere there's like a drop-down menu [that] only goes to 72 pointBut that's obviously way too small so we can input our own number year to make the types a lot biggerSo let's say [five] [hundred]. Yeah, that's good. So that's our example. Text as you can see thereSo that looks pretty cooland then we can also mess around with some of the settings [um]For the actual text itself like effects so we can go to Fx and then blending options and then from hereWe can go to let's say overlay blend mode and then blend mode is [basically] what it does. It's likeThere's different blend modes that do different things like difference is basically like it. It does opposite colors, and then you can doExclusion which is essentially does the same thing darken that that it doesn't really work thereBut you [you] can basically just mess around with that and different different settings different backgroundsThere's different effects that work better than others so for this oneWe're actually going to go [difference] that actually [looked] really cooland then if we just move around you guys can see it Kinda does like anX-Ray Sort of Filter on the background itself on what it's um. You know on what it's on so that looks really coolYou can still see the clouds and everything on [an] actual background. It's basically just the like polar opposite of what the colors are soYeah, that's it's really simple to add text and [photoshop]You [can] also do other effects like drop shadow all everything else that we learned in the effects panel, okay?So now let's say I wanted to erase a part of the McLaren so we can actually use the eraser tool. Which is also veryStraightforward to use, so there's this little tool like this little eraser icon thatWe can select here once we selected that we're going to go up to here and actuallySelect the size, so let's go 100 around 100 pixelsand then we're gonna actually decrease if you have a hardness on like 50 [percent] by default just decrease it down tolet's Saywe're just going to go to 0% for now actually and then I'll show you guys the difference when youactually increase the hardness of the eraser, so now we're going to select thethe duplicated [Maclaren] layer, and then we're going to start erasing so as you guys can see you erase parts of theOf this layer using this simple eraser tooland now let's say we go step backward and then we go toThe hardness and we increase it to 100% just to show you guys the complete oppositeSo let's select the McLAren layer againAnd then we can actually just erase it directly and as you guys can see it's a lot differentIt's a lot like crisperAnd then I can show you guys a side-by-side by decreasing the hardness then going back and as you guys can see hereIt's a lot softer like the way. It's it races on. [they're] just crisp puts a crisp lineSo that's essentially the difference between you know and then you can also select a different like brushes for the eraserso that's like sort of like a a nice little um apen sort of brush or like a a paint brush sort of not a pen a paint brush sort ofStyle to the eraser so you can do lots of cool styles with that actually but um let's for nowLet's just go control z first step backward step backward and just go back to where it was so umyeah, that's basically the eraser tool and IWanted to show you guys one more thing before I end this first essentials, sort of like basics tutorial is umI'm going to show you guys the pen tool now the pen tool is something that issort of likeHow you make logos how you make like objects?How you make shapes and stuff [um] in in photoshop, and this is a very essentialTool that you must learn so let's go let's make another new project a blank project, so let's go1920 by1080 orWe can actually just go back to this one[I] actually forget that so let's just delete that and then we have a back the white background hereWe don't really have to delete it. We can just click on the visibility icon and just hide itso let's make a shape, so let's say we want it to make a a aLetter Z sowe can start bySelecting a point here, and then let's say we wanted to make a another point here, [so] a letters that look something like thatRight, but that that's not necessarily straight, so we go controller vault[C4] Step BackwardAnd then we can we cannot keep this anchor [point] here however when we select the second pointWe can hold shift down which basically makes it straightSee as you guys can see this is a perfect straight lineNow to do itDiagonally we can also do the shift tool you use the shift tool then if you want to move this we canselect cTRL and then shift or sorry not shift just [cTRL] and then and then now once you'veDragged it to where you want. We can click shift and as you guys can see there. It's straightSo let's put it right there that looks good[and] then we can also select the third pointby clicking shift and right there so now we're going to actually make [it] like [three-dimensional] [and]There we go, you can press [control] to edit that onepoint and then let's bring it up to here click shift to make it straight andthen add another point by clicking shift and make it straight of [course] and thenfinishing this objectOnce you once you're finishedand then you want to likeclose the object um you guys can see that little circle icon busted besides light beside like the pen tool and thenOnce you click that it basically makes it a shapeAnd then you know we can right click create a let's let's define a customshape actually and let's name it zso and then we can click enter and so let's actually go to this rectangle icon and then Iselect custom shape tool and then from herethere's a little drop-down menu we can select all the custom shapes that we have andthe most recent ones are on the bottom so your icon that you probably just made is [on] the bottom andWe can click anywhere on the screenAnd then have this is like the default width and height I guess soMake sure you're always on preserveproportions if you want to look exactly how you made it and then you can you can adjust the height and width but I'm justGonna leave it like that for now, so this is the shape [that] we have andAs you guys can see you can't really see [it]. It's probably because it's whiteSo we're going to go to the effects and then we're going to go tocolor overlay andThen yeah we can change the color to whatever you want.
