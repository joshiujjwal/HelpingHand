hey everyone welcome to the Hobby Lobbycreative studio I'm Sarah why are youready to learn how to knit it's really alot easier than you might think I've gota great easy-to-follow tutorial to getyou started so don't go away[Music]well one thing is for sure knitting isdefinitely making a comeback andrightfully so it seems like people ofall ages are knitting these daysyou really can't knit so many coolthings and you only need a few suppliesto do a knitting project some yarn apair of knitting needles some finishingneedles and a pair of scissors of courseso we need to talk about yarn andneedles first off how do you know whatkind of needles to buy well there arelots of different needles out there tochoose from lots of different finishesavailable as well so it's really fun toexperiment and find out which kind offinish that you prefer a lot ofbeginners choose to purchase some 10inch long bamboo needles like these herebamboo needles are really nice to usebecause they're not quite as smoothshiny or polished as other finishes canbe which means that your yarn is justgonna stay put a little bit better onthese needles and not slide around quiteas much and trust me as a beginneryou're going to appreciate when youryarn slides around as little as possibleif you're wondering what kind of yarn tobuy look for a medium weight yarn with asmooth texture how you know it's amedium weight yarn is indicated by thislittle number 4 here on the label righton top of this little yarn icon and thenjust make sure that it's got a smoothtexture because you're going to be ableto see your stitches much more easilythat way save those fancy fuzzy yarnsfor later when you've become morecomfortable with knittingthe first thing we ever have to do whenstarting a knitting project is to caston there are a lot of different methodsof casting on but no matter which oneyou choose what you're essentially doingis creating a foundational row ofstitches for the rest of your piece tobe built on so I'm just gonna keep itreally simple for you today and show youhow to do the easiest I think of all thecast on methods which is the single caston this is a really easy cast on forbeginners to learn especially and itreally allows you to get some stitchesonto your needle very quickly so let meshow you how to do that cast on now thefirst thing we do when we cast on is wemake a slipknot to make a slipknotjust work at one end of your yarn herethere's lots of different ways to make aslipknot but I just like to use my twofingers and wrap the yarn all the wayaround them once and then halfway aroundagain and then put this piece of yarnthrough this loop that you've now formedon your fingers and pull it through andthen you should have what looks like apiece ribbon so in this loop now insertyour knitting needle and now the workingpiece of yarn which is still the pieceof yarn that's attached to your yarnball or your yarn skein should be thepiece that when you pull on it ittightens up this Slipknot so if it's notyou've just got it reversed so just takeyour pieces of yarn off reverse them anentire Slipknot again and you should begood to go so with your end of yarn herewe're going to tuck that away and justkeep a hold of it with our right handthen we're gonna pick up our workingpiece of yarn with our left hand andjust kind of drape it over your fourfingers just like this leaving yourthumb free now go ahead and close yourfingers around your yarn and you'veformed what looks like a thumbs up sofrom this point you're going to scoopyour thumb onto the front side of youryarn wrap it all the way around the backand then return to that thumbs upposition then you're going to dip yourneedle inside of this loop that you'venow formed on your thumb start to pushit through and then release your thumbcompletely from that loop and thenreturn to that same thumbs up positionand do this again so you're going toscoop rotate all the way around till youend back up and you'rethumbs up scoop this into your loop andrelease your thumb completely and pullit so that it's just a comfortable fiton your needle so this is really a quickway to cast on it's very simple and easyand if I could give you a piece ofadvice for this cast on method it wouldbe to make sure that your stitches staynice and loose and comfortable on yourneedle you don't to pull them so tightthat they are squeezing the life out ofyour needle you just want them to benice and loose and relaxed on yourneedle because what you're going to bedoing is going into these stitcheswhenever you knit your first row so themore relaxed your stitches are at thispoint the easier it's gonna be to getyour needle through your cast onstitches now that you know how to caston it's time to learn a couple ofstitches there are two basic stitches ofknitting the knit stitch and the purlstitch so this is what a knit stitchlooks like it kind of has the look oflittle V's doesn't it so let me show youhow to make the knit stitch now to dothe knit stitchI've already got my foundational Rovestitches set up on my needle using ourcast on method and now what I want to dois concentrate on the stitch that's theclosest to the tip of my needle so whatyou're gonna do is with your rightneedle in your right hand you're goingto insert your needle through the frontof the loop pushing it to the back sideand you're gonna make what kind of lookslike an X at this point then you'regoing to pick up your working piece ofyarn with your right hand wrap it aroundthe back needle counterclockwise andthen you're just gonna kind of push itthrough the front of this loop now youjust want to slip that stitch completelyoff of your left needle and now we havea stitch on our right needle so let's dothat again so now we're going toconcentrate on the next closest stitchto the tip of our needle here and we'regoing to insert the right needle throughthe front of the loop now that it's onthe back sidemakes kind of this X shape like thisthey're gonna take your working piece ofyarn and wrap it around counterclockwiseand then you're going to push it throughback to the front side of your leftneedle and then slip that stitch offcompletely of your left needle go infrom the front of the loop wrap aroundcounterclockwise push your right needleback under the front side of your leftneedle and then slip the stitch offcompletely so that it ends up on yourright needle so this is probably themost difficult part right here isknitting into the very first row of yourcast on stitches but don't worry that'swhat I'm here forI'm gonna walk you through every step ofthis and it really just takes a lot ofpractice to get it right and a lot ofpatience to I promise anybody who everstarted knitting had plenty of jumbledmesses to show for it when they firststarted so just practice practicepracticeand I promise that eventually it willjust all clicklet's talk about the purl stitch nowthis is what the purl stitch looks likekind of looks like horizontal links in achain doesn't it so let me now show youhow to do the purl stitch once againI've just got my single row of cast onstitches on my needle and before we doany work what we want to do is actuallypull the working yarn to the front ofour work space because we werepreviously working with it back herewith a knit stitch but now we're goingto be working on the front side of ourneedle and so we want to complement thatand bring the working yarn to the frontside as well so after you've done thatyou can take up your empty needle inyour right hand and this time what we'regoing to do is still concentrating onthe closest stitch to the tip of theneedle we're going to insert our needlefrom right to left now on the front sideof the Left needle so find your waythrough that stitch on the front sideand we're gonna make an X shape now justlike we did with the knit stitch but nowthe right needle is on top of the leftneedle so with our working yarn here atthe front we're going to wrap it aroundcounterclockwise and then push itthrough that stitch to the back side andthen slip that stitch off of your leftneedle completely so now we have astitch on our right needle so let's dothat again we're going to go into ourstitch on the front side right to leftwrap your yarn around counterclockwiseand then push that stitch through theback side and slip that stitch off ofyour needle so purling very similar tothe knit stitch you're just working onthe front side of your left needleinstead of the back sidewhatever you're done knitting yourproject to your desired length orwhatever length your pattern is calledfor it's time to do what we call bindingoff binding off has done across yourentire row and it results in a niceclean finished edge that won't unravelso an easy and effective bind off methodis called the basic bind off so let meshow you how to do the basic bind off todo the basic bind off what you're goingto do is knit the first two stitcheshere on your left needle so go into eachone just like you're doing a regularknit stitch and transfer that stitch toyour right needle so there's one two sowhen you have two stitches here on yourright needle what you're gonna do is usethe tip of your left needle here and gointo the stitch that's furthest awayfrom the tip so your second stitch hereand then you're going to kind of pull itup and over your first stitch here andthen drop it off and now you're leftwith one stitch on your right needle andthen you're just going to repeat that sothat you end up with two stitches againon your right needle so go into thestitch again just like you're gonna knitit and now it's on your right needle andthen again with your left needle bringthat back stitch up and over the frontone just like that and you would do thisacross your entire row so when you're atthe point where you've gone across yourentire row and you've got one stitchleft on your left needle and two on yourright needle go ahead and pick thisstitch up like you were doing before andbring it up and over the front onenow you're going to once you have twostitches left here on your right needleagain you're just going to bring theback one up and over the front one sothat we end up with one stitch left sowhen you're at this pointpull up slightly to kind of make alarger loop right here and go ahead andclip your yarn and now you can pull thatyarn through that loop and pull up justlike that so now we're ready to weave inour ends so when we're done with aknitting project we have an end leftwhere we just did our binding off andthen we have it in left at the beginningwhere we did our cast on stitches sowhat we need to do is weave in thosetails and why we don't just leave themloose or cut them off at this point isbecause we just want to mace make ouredges more secure and weave them in sothat the edges are nice and strong andthat it doesn't unravel so I have alittle finishing needle here and theseare really handy they're very flexibleand they open really easily so justinsert the end of your yarn through thecenter of your finishing needle and thenwhat you're gonna do is just weave youryarn into some already existing stitchesI like to go across the edge becausethat's typically where your stitches arethe thickest and it will camouflagethose ends better than another spot onyour project so just go into somealready existing stitches here acrossyour edge and you could do this untilyou've got all of your end woven in oryou could just do it enough times whereyou feel like it's nice and secure andthen you could cut it off at that pointas close as you can to your project soyou would do this on both sides andthat's how you weave in your endswell that's all for today everyone I'msure glad you stopped by and gaveknitting a try with me today keeppracticing
