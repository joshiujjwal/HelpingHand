what's up everybody Peter MacKinnon hereand today we're talking about how tomake your photos look better fast okayso you don't when you get home somewhereyou've been taking photos maybe vacationmaybe trip hanging out with friends andyou load that photo on your computer andyou're like oh this looks so good throwit up on the social Facebook Instagrampeople are double tap and that IG heartsare flowing and you're just feeling goodabout yourself ready for sunset and it'sjust so beautiful and then there'ssometimes you get home and you open thatphoto up on your computer and you'relike I remember this being way betterwhen I was there promise so these aresome basic editing skills basic editingskills that you can do on yourphotographs at home at any time usingPhotoshop I'm using Photoshop CC so goahead head over to Adobe and downloadthe trial of that or sign up for theirsubscription base to service which iswhat I do and you pay a monthly fee tobasically own all of their apps that'swhat I recommend we can take a mundanephoto that looks like this and turn itinto something that looks like this inpretty much like 10 minutes maybe evenfaster if you do this thing on a dailybasis like I dookay so we've dragged our photo intoPhotoshop and here we are we are hitwith the Camera Raw plug-in that pops upand says hey this is a raw file what doyou want to do you want to just open theimage as is do you want to tweak it alittle bit here with Camera Raw and thenopen it and this is where you might sayto me Pete well what's the differencebetween editing and doing everythingyou're about to show me in Lightroominstead of using Lightroom and Photoshopwe're using Camera Raw and Photoshopyeah you can do everything in Lightroomyou can do everything in Photoshop it'sall about workflow what programs youlike better I like using them both photoshops more of like a photo manipulatorwhere you can I don't like that guy'sface I'm going to put his face on hisface great for that kind of thingbut I like using them both inconjunction with one another and I'mgoing to show you how I do it right heredoesn't take long don't be nervous orlike oh this is10 it's intense if you don't payattention but no we're going to ripthrough this so Camera Raw I'm justgoing to tweak the exposure bring up thecontrast a little bit highlight you'llsee in the mountain there at the top Idrag them all the way to the right theyblow out if I bring them all the waydown it's a little too dark but I'mhappy kind of just just a little southof the center their shadows I'm finewith you can see really only affectsthat t-shirt we drag them all the way upbut I don't want I don't want it to bethis right it's just a little bit weirda little bit awkward if you will I'lldrag them up to like 25 will be halfwill meet in the middle the white I'mhappy with the whites the black that'sgood the clarity I always like to tweaka little bit because it just defines allthose edges and really sharpens theimage nicely straight into Photoshop thevibrance we're going to up a little bita little bit more saturation and thenbecause of those clarity adjustments wejust did that sometimes darkens theimage you might want to go back and justbring that exposure up slightly and thenwe're going to hit open image ok here weare the first thing I usually do withthe photo is clean up any dust onsomeone's shirt or if they have bad skinI usually go over their skin with abrush tool like this Spot Healing Brushthat kind of thing and if you watched mytutorial on how to float things in yourphotos this is the same brush that I'musing and I'm just clicking to get ridof any dust or specksthat's just brush over here on the leftside right below the color picker andit's just like look you clicked on soyou can kind of clean up any spots thatyou want to smooth over with this brushnow sometimes if you were to clicksomething too big like let's say I madethis brush size huge and click you canactually see the outline of the circleso you don't want to do that if you wantto get rid of this little red mark hereyou'd be better off hitting s whichgives you the clone stamp you hold downoption select the area you want to cloneand then you click tooin that area over and I'm happy withpretty much just that right there he'sgot good skin as it is so I am ready togo now with Photoshop you never want tojust edit the bottom layer and juststart taking on your layers and layersan hour goes by you crushed an entirepizza and then you realize to yourselfOh his eyes are a little bit too darkand go back and change that you're likewhoops sorryyou flatten that image and bake thoseedits into that into that photo like 38minutes ago there's no going back but ifyou do everything on layers you canalways delete a layer go back deletewhat you did tweak that layersadjustments change the colors so youalways want to work in layers now Idon't just duplicate the background Ishift option command n is going to giveyou a new layer and then what I do isstamp visible layer on top of thatsounds crazy already right but hang onshift option command e paste that imageinto the new layer we just made insteadof just duplicating a layer if I've madea bunch of edits to a layer that isduplicate it to duplicate those editswith it I don't want that I just want toclean start so I can manipulate that andthen blend everything together thatdoesn't make senserewind watch it if you still rebound andwatch it doesn't make sense do a shotcome back it'll make sense okayI'm going to start by sharpening theimage and by doing that I start byblurring the image first soundscounterintuitive yes but this is whyyou're going to go over to filter blurGaussian blur I have it preset to 5 soset your radius of 5 hit OK change theblending mode down here in your layerspanel to stop light oh look at that itlooks warmit looks more punchy it already lookscooler but yeah I know it's blurryyou're like why would I just want tojust wreck an image to try and make itbetter sometimes you got to setsomething free to what's the same yougot to let it you got to let it go tomake it come back or if you let you loveit set it free what it doesn't matterchanging the opacity to 50%hit enter okay now if we use that littleeyeball they're visible and invisibleyou can see how it's warmed his skin upit's kind of added just glow this nicesmooth aspect to it soothing comfortingif you will and we can see that by justclicking the eyeball on and off now iswhere we're going to sharpen it so againI'm going to shift option command n fora new layer shift option command E tostamp that layer on top and I'm going todesaturate this because I don't want toaffect the colors when I'm sharpening itI just want to affect the lightness inthe darkness while I'm sharpening it soshift command U is going to take allthat color right gone change thatblending mode to overlay you're going togo oh my goodness Pete what this lookslike a scene from the Croke what is thisnonsense heading on with me here go upto filter other we're going to run ahigh pass on it what just happenedI know magic you'll see that weird crowlike filter just vanished and now wehave something that looks a littlesharper you're going to hit okay nowlet's zoom in to his face here take alook at what's happened if we hide thatit's blurrywe unhide it it's sharp now if we unhidethat and unhide this you'll see thecolors have not only been pumped up alittle bit in saturation but that skinsnice and smooth and now it's sharp andwe zoom out and it's looking pretty goodgosh darn it if you want to double thoseeffects if you want to say you know whatI could use a little bit more of thatsharp reapeat or I like the skin to lookeven more dreamy hold down commandselect both those layers drag them downto this new layers tab and that's goingto duplicate the layers with all of theeffects now that's too strong for me sowhile those two layers are still wellwhile they're still selectedeven think of what to say there changeyour opacity to whatever suits your yourfancy I'm going to go down to like 20 Idon't want to really over exaggerateduplicating those effects but justenough that it gives me a little littlemore okay what do we do now Pete well itcould use some warm it's not winter timeright now in this photo but it's lookinga little too cold so we're going to warmthe photo up and we're going to do thatby you guessed it shift command shiftoption command and new layer and thenwe're going to shift delete that's goingto bring up the content aware box andyou're going to hit color under contentwhich then opens up the color picker Ihave orange selected there's thehexadecimal code if you want to see thatF 5 7 9 0 0 you can plug that into thesame spot and you'll end up with thesame color orange that I'm using but itall depends on the photo you're editingso kind of doesn't matter hit OKhit OK again and now you have it looksbeautiful a nice solid pumpkin lookingphoto completely orange change thatblending mode down here to soft lightand now it looks a little better itstill looks like he has jaundice andthings are going bad we're going tochange that opacity to like I don't knowmaybe like 15 and say 15 is like a goodspot maybe maybe 13 I wanted to go 10but then 16 so 13 in the middle ofsounds like I'm happy with that so nowthat looks warmer so let's hide all ofthese and see what we've done see howit's looking better already with not badnow what if I wanted to make his eyesbrighter or make the mountains in thebackground darker because they're alittle too washed out or his eyes and Ilook a little too dark because of allthe sharpening and the saturation thatwe've added with the Gaussian blur we'lljust how you're going to do that you'regoing to make a new layer shift optioncommand n you're going to stamp thatvisible on there and you're going tograb the last suit tool hold commanddown get plus on your keyboard that'sgoing to zoom inif you hold spacebar this is a littlehand pop-up and you can use that hand tomove the image around command + again tozoom in and we're just going to selectthe iris I don't want to make the whitesof his eyes too bright because thenhe'll look like someone from the walkingdead so once we selected that you'll seethat little selection of what's calledmarching ants that means this area isselected you hold shift you'll see alittle plus pop-up beside the lassolasso lasso lasso whatever select theother eye be very careful not to go toomuch into the skin but it's okay and nowwe've got both eyes selected now you'regoing to come down here and make a newadjustment layer with brightness andcontrast click on that now if we up thatbrightness you'll see just the eyeballsare getting brighter now that'sterrifying that straight up looks like azombie if we zoom out there unless Imean if that's what you're going foryou're done but not not here we're justgoing to up that just a little bit Idon't want it to be too obvious if youbrighten someone's eyes up is way toomuch people know and it looks that it'slike oh that guy had some fun inPhotoshop we don't want that we want itto be subtle the more subtle edits thatwe apply to this just a more pleasingit's going to end up in the endso I'm just bumping that a little rightthere it's fine 24 for me I am good togo with that now we're going to makeanother layer again and what I'm goingto do with this layer is darken thosemounds in the backgroundsame thing shift option command andshift option command II I feel like Ihave to keep saying that in case peopleare tuning in or zoning in and out soI'm sorryand I just apologize past because I'mCanadian in half because I am sorry butanyway let's get back to this whatyou're going to do is again with thatlast new tool you're just going to drawa line along the waterline over his headover the trees just like this up thatborder of the photo across the top andacross the left side back down rightthere happy with that now we've got ourselection here same thing adjustmentlayercurds this time now we're going to usethis curve and we're going to bring downthat brightness so we're going to crushit here even more - we talked aboutmaking that s curved when using curvesbut right now I just want to make itdarker but in doing so it just made itreally blue and like I said we're tryingto get rid of it feeling like it'swinter because it's the middle of summerin this photo so we can change from RGBto red Channel and then we can push moreReds on to end now we don't want to looklike Mars so we're just going to tweakthat slightly just a little bit I'mhappy with that it's a little too purpleit's good right about there again I'mtrying to be subtle with this and we'regoing to close that now because it's anadjustment layer we can hit B for ourbrush tool close bracket to make that alittle bit smaller and then we can paintaway that harsh line right there we'rejust going to paint over that edge andget rid of that harsh line because thatdoes not look good and then I'm going todrop the opacity of this whole thing tolike 60 now if we hide that layer you'llsee what's happened it's just basicallydrops the brightness and the contrast inthe top of the mountains and just kindof define them a little more they gotlost and I wanted to bring them backinto focus and that's basicallyaccomplished by doing that now the lastthing you can do is shift option commandn shift option command E and then youcan desaturate this again and this isjust if you want a little more contrastand mood in this photo which I like todo in my shots but will be saturatedwith shift command U and then I'm goingto change that blending mode to overlaylike we did right before we added thehigh-pass filter but now I'm just goingto drop that opacity to like I don'tknow 15 I'm going to preview see whatthat does for me it just adds a littlemore attitude I'm happy with this itcould just use a slight overall bump inbrightness so the last thing this is thelast layer we're going to add here I'mgoing to add an adjustment layer forcurves and I'm just going to take thebottom here and bump those curves upjust a littlelittle bit just ever so slightly notmaking a big deal of it that's it I'mgoing to select that top layer I'm goingto hold down shift and I'm going toclick the bottom layer right above thebackground I'm going to hit command Git's going to group all of our editstogether and we can double click on thatand name it edit and now when we look atthis photo if we just hide this layerthat's what we started with after weadjusted it in the Camera Raw plug-in atthe beginning now it looks like this soI'm going to flatten this image just forexample sake and then I'm going to bringin this camera edit again so you can seeit but I'm going to reset we're going togo back to default to what it lookedlike I'm going to open that image I'mgoing to copy it close that window andI'm going to paste it onto this and thatis a pretty accurate representation ofwhat the photo looked like coming out ofthe camera and what it looks like nowafter we've applied our edits again thisis all personal preference you might notlike your photos as contrast being apunchy or to pop as much as this andthat's the beauty of being photographersand artists and editing is that you canmake it look however you want it to lookand the more that you stay consistentwith that style the more it becomes yourstyle and people start to pick up onshots that you take without even knowingyou took them because they say hey thatlooks a lot like how piece photos lookvery peter McKinnon and it's really coolto start seeing your own style developso if this is a cup of tea there's noworries with that you can play aroundwith all those settings kind of followthe same basic steps and come up withsomething yourself that looks prettysimilar it looks completely differenteverything's okay but we went from thisto this and I'd say that's a prettynifty little edit and not much time sothat's it guys thank you so much forwatching I really appreciate it if youliked this video hit that like buttondrop me a comment below let me know whatyou thought I love hearing from you guysand interacting and I'll see you in thenext tutorial or the next vlog whichevercomes first[Music]
