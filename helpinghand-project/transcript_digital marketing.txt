SEO, social media marketing, email marketing,
PPC advertising.Where do you start and how do you use these
to get more traffic to your website?If you're a beginner to digital marketing
and you want to cut through the noise,then keep watching because I'm going 
to show you how all of these workbased on a decade of experience rather than just theory.Stay tuned.[music]What's up marketers, Sam Oh here with Ahrefs,
the SEO tool that helps you grow your search traffic,research your competitors and dominate your niche.Today, I'm going to share 7 digital marketing
strategies that I have personally usedand gotten results with.And if there's only one thing that you take away 
from this video, it's to not try all of these at once.Instead, pick one of these strategies, experiment
and master the channel before moving on to the next.Let's get to it.So before we dig into these strategies, you
need to make sure that you're adopting today'smindset of the consumer.Today, we live in a "content first" world.People are looking for information before they buy.So you need to really put yourself in the
buyer's shoes rather than allowing yourselfto get blinded by how great you think your
products and services are.The mentality you need to adopt is to help
people rather than trying to cold sell them.When you help people solve problems through
free and valuable content that is relevantto your business, you reach larger audiences
and build trust.The best part is that you get the opportunity
to show people how your products and servicescan help them solve their problems and fulfill
their desires and needs.Alright, so the first internet marketing strategy
is blogging with SEO in mind.Now, blogging isn't writing about what you
did today or even something more noblelike an epiphany you had.That's a diary.But don't get me wrong.This kind of content can work well if you
have an existing and loyal audience.But for most of us that just want to get more
traffic, leads, and sales we need to intentionallytarget problems that your target audience
wants to solve.In the world of blogging, this whole process can be summed up as a technique called keyword research.Let me show you two clear-cut examples on
how keyword research works.In the first example, let's say you sell physical
products like computer parts and accessories.What do you think future customers might be
searching for in Google?Probably questions like:Why is my computer so slow?How to build a computer?How to speed up a computer?These are all very real problems and people
are looking for solutions.In fact, Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer tells us
that these exact search queries get tens ofthousands of searches each month.Now, the best part about these specific queries
is that you can help people solve their problems,while integrating products from your store 
in the content."Why is my computer so slow" could come down
to a hard drive, CPU, or ram problem.So help your readers diagnose the problem
and offer product solutions within your post."How to build a computer" would be a super
easy plug for any computer components.They're already showing intent to build,so it's unlikely that they've already purchased 
parts and peripherals.Alright, second example.Let's say you're a real estate agent and you're
compensated when someone buys,sells, or rents a property.Now, the thing that most agents do is boast
about how many homes they've soldor how they won an award that you nor I 
have never heard of.My point is that the average buyer or seller doesn't care.And to prove my point, no one is searching
for things like:which realtor won the most awards in New York?But again, potential customers are looking
for solutions to their problems.Problems like:How to invest in real estate?How to buy a house?What credit score is needed to buy a house?And again, these all have the potential to
attract a massive audience.By ranking in Google for something like "how
to invest in real estate,"you're now attracting potential buyers with deep pockets and they likely have intent to buy.Content on "how to buy a house" would likely
require the work of an agent at some point,which could be you."What credit score is needed to buy a house"
is a great way to show that your knowledgeand intentions go beyond making a sale.The best thing about blogging for SEO is that
once you rank, you'll be getting free, consistentand passive traffic from Google.If you're new to SEO, I highly recommend watching
our SEO for beginners video,which will give you a nice overview of what SEO is, 
how it works, and how you can get it to work for you.I'll also link up some additional resources
on doing keyword research that grows trafficand revenue, as well as a video on how to write
a blog post with SEO in mind.For now, let's move on to the second strategy, 
which is to invest in video content,specifically on YouTube.YouTube is the second most visited search 
engine in existence.To top that off, video carousels nearly doubled
in 2017 in Google's search results.Video isn't just the future.It's the present.And the same principle of helping potential
customers works for video too.When people go to video search engines like YouTube,they're looking to find answers to their questions.For example, if you bought a so-called "new"
iPhone X on eBay, you might search for"iPhone X unboxing" and see if all of the contents 
are in the box.And according to Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer,
108,000 searches are happening eachmonth globally on YouTube alone for this keyword.In fact, this video that you're watching right now
was chosen because I can see that people arespecifically looking for digital marketing
tutorials for beginners.To come up with topic ideas that people are
searching for in your niche,head over to Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer, switch the search engine to YouTubeand search for a broad keyword in your niche.Let's use "makeup" as an example.Now, "makeup" as a standalone keyword isn't a problem.So let's go to the Questions report,where you can see popular questions people are searching for on your topic.And right away, you'll see great topic ideas
like "how to clean makeup brushes"and how to cover acne with makeup.Now, when you're creating these videos, try
and keep the fluff out and pack in as muchnecessary value as possible.Doing this has helped us grow our YouTube
views to over 150,000 views per monthand best of all, since all of our videos show
how our SEO tools can help,it's led to thousands of new paying leads and customers,specifically mentioning that they found us through YouTube.Most of our video growth was done through
YouTube SEO, so I'll leave links to a tutorialto help you rank your videos and get more views.Next up is social media marketing.Rather than covering every social media network,
I want to pass on a couple of important tipsthat will help you grow your social channels.The first is to focus on just one social media
channel when you're just starting out.It takes time to build a following.But numbers aren't everything.What you want is a loyal following.When you dip your toes into every possible
social media network out there,your attention gets divided and the results get diluted.So which social media marketing channel do 
you choose?That leads us into the second tip,which is to go where your target audience is 
and cater to the platform.If you have to choose just one social network,it's not about choosing the one with the 
most active users.It's all about understanding the audience
that's there and if you can serve the reasonfor them being there.You really need to think about why someone
is logging into the specific social media network.For example, people usually go to YouTube
to learn how to do something, or to be entertained.But Facebook is different. Think about it.Have you ever logged onto Facebook, hoping
that you would see an unboxing tutorial?Or better yet, have you ever opened your Facebook
app hoping you would find a limited time offerthat's 97% off, only for the next 37 minutes?Probably not.People don't check Facebook with credit card in hand.People like and share things that are helpful,
interesting, shocking or funny.So if you are going to try and bring people
into your world, present your message asa story, video, or something else that will
likely stand out from the endless feedof vacation vanity shots.Pinterest on the other hand is primarily a
social search enginewhere people can control what they want to search for.The primary intent of users on this platform
is to get inspired, learn things, and plan to do things.So create content that caters to their intent 
for being there.So if this is your audience, take advantage
of a less competitive landscape from bothan ads and organic perspective.Speaking of ads, that's the next digital marketing
strategy on the list for today.When it comes to paid advertising, please do not 
throw your money blind into an ad networkbecause you read that it was good.What works for one person won't necessarily
work for the next person.Instead, think about the ABCs of paid advertising.A is for audience, B is for budgetand C is for commerciality.We've already covered the audience part.You want to engage on social networks where
your target audience hangs out.Budget is the next one.Bloomberg reported that Google and Facebook
own a combined 58% of the $111 billion dollar market.Now, the way ads work are usually based on auctions.The more advertisers there are, the more expensive
it gets for you and I.So let's say you're in the ultra competitive
industry of conference calling.If we search for that keyword in Keywords
Explorer with Google set as the search engine,you'll see that the cost per click from Google Ads is $20!If you have an ad budget of let's say $1,000
per month, then you'd only be able to get50 clicks before your budget was depleted.Instead, you can do two things:The first option is to look for keywords that
have a lower cost per click.Just go to the Phrase match report to see
all keywords in our keyword database thatcontain your target keyword.Next, set a filter to only show keywords that
have a maximum cost per clickof something lower like $5.From here, you can filter through the list
and see if there are some more lucrative opportunitiesrather than spending $20 per click.This one for a "conference call app" might
be a good one since it's a quarter of the price.Another benefit is that the reason behind
the searcher's query is more clear.Someone searching for this is clearly looking
for an app that does conference calls,whereas someone searching for just "conference 
call" could be looking for many different things.The second thing you can do is experiment
with less popular ad platformswhere your target audience might be.Finally is commerciality.Now, all major ad platforms are able to bring
ROI for their advertisers.Otherwise, they wouldn't exist.But you have to find a way to bridge the gap
between the intent of the platformand how you monetize your products.And the solution is going to be content.For example, let's say you sell boutique furniture
and think that Pinterest will be a good platformto run some ads.In my opinion, it wouldn't be a good idea
to advertise a bunch of links to high-endfurniture like couches and dining tables.Instead, blog posts could work really well
here since people log on to Pinterest mainlyto get inspired, and learn new things.Here's what that bridge might look like.Pinterest ads would be the discovery tool.You pay them money and they'll show your pin.The bridge would then be a helpful blog post
on let's say, "11 Interior Design Tips ForYour Living Room That Won't Break the Bank."And within that content, you could showcase your products where it supports the tip you're speaking of.Nail the ABCs of paid ads, and increase your
chances of actually converting your hard earneddollars into ROI.Next up is one of my favorites and that's podcasts.Now, there are two ways to look at podcasts.First is to create your own and the second
is to be interviewed on someone else's podcast.Creating your own podcast can be great for
brand and building an audience.But if you're just starting out, it can take
quite a bit of time to get any sort of traction.Getting interviewed on podcasts is a different story.Podcasters are always looking for interesting
people to interview.Even if you don't have a ton of experience
in the online world, your offline experiencesand expertise could be a great way to land
yourself a position on a popular podcast.Now, if you don't know which podcasts you
should approach, an easy way to find opportunitiesis to look at your favorite podcasts and find
someone in your industry that has been interviewed.Looking at the podcast page for Entrepreneur 
on Fire, you'll see this episode with Jim Kwik.Now, if we click through to the interview,
you'll notice two things.The first is that the guest's name is in the title.This is very common for podcast interviews.Second is the link on the page.The host will almost always link to the guest's
home page in the show notes.Knowing this, we can use a tool like Ahrefs'
Site Explorer to find all podcasts they'vebeen interviewed on.So I'll enter in jimkwik.com and I'll also
set the search mode to a URL search so wecan find pages that are linking specifically
to the homepage.Once the overview page loads, go to the backlinks
report, which will show you all of the pagesthat are linking to this URL.Finally, let's use the Include search and
type in Jim Kwik.And to keep our results super relevant, I'm
going to set the filter to search for hisname only in the titles of the referring pages.And we now have around 120 podcasts we can
pitch to get interviewed.So filter through relevant podcasts, and pitch
the host as to why they should interview youand the value you can give to their audience.Next on the list is email marketing.If you've ever looked into email marketing,then you've probably heard people claiming 
that "email is king."But I promise you that once you get into it,
you'll quickly discover that it's not as turnkeyas online gurus make it sound.And don't get me wrong.Email marketing is great.But first, you need traffic to get email subscribers.It also requires opt-in forms to turn a visitor
into a subscriber.In my opinion, email is a great long play
to build connection with your audience andand even sell high ticket items.So my tip for you on email marketing is quite simple:First, focus on building your email list from day one.It's important and you might as well collect
emails from interested people from the start,even if it's not a substantial list.But be realistic with your goals and as you build
your audience, put more time into your emaillist and see how it can serve your business.The final strategy is to use forums and 
community boards.Community forums like Quora, Reddit, and Facebook
are great promotion channels.But before you go off and start posting links
to your product pages,there are a few things you need to understand.And these are all based around the unspoken
rules of spam.First: don't promote your products or services
pages within these groups.The intent of users on these platforms is to learn.Not to be sold to directly.Instead, think of these networks as a place
to share your expertise,build relationships and help others.Second: use links to your content sparingly.If you're constantly posting links to your
blog and have justified in your head thatthat this is non-promotional, then you're most 
likely wrong.Links can be more appropriate based on the
network you're posting on.For example, Quora generally has longer answers,and linking to your content where it supports your point is a good idea.Facebook groups on the other hand are a different
story.Let's say you're a real estate agent and you
join a "first time homebuyers" group on Facebook.If someone asks a question like:
"I'm looking to buy my first home and waswondering if I can even get a mortgage?"Now, if every agent on that group posts links to their website,can you see how spammy that could get?Instead, it would make sense to post a link
to someone else's affordability calculatorsor offer introductions to b-lenders.The point is that helping first will go a
lot farther than self-promotional contentthat can taint your reputation.Now, I'd love to hear from you.Which digital marketing strategy do you think
is most effective in online marketing?Let me know in the comments and if you enjoyed

need to make sure that you're adopting today'smindset of the consumer.Today, we live in a "content first" world.People are looking for information before they buy.So you need to really put yourself in the
buyer's shoes rather than allowing yourselfto get blinded by how great you think your
products and services are.The mentality you need to adopt is to help
people rather than trying to cold sell them.When you help people solve problems through
free and valuable content that is relevantto your business, you reach larger audiences
and build trust.The best part is that you get the opportunity
to show people how your products and servicescan help them solve their problems and fulfill
their desires and needs.Alright, so the first internet marketing strategy
is blogging with SEO in mind.Now, blogging isn't writing about what you
did today or even something more noblelike an epiphany you had.That's a diary.But don't get me wrong.This kind of content can work well if you
have an existing and loyal audience.But for most of us that just want to get more
traffic, leads, and sales we need to intentionallytarget problems that your target audience
wants to solve.In the world of blogging, this whole process can be summed up as a technique called keyword research.Let me show you two clear-cut examples on
how keyword research works.In the first example, let's say you sell physical
products like computer parts and accessories.What do you think future customers might be
searching for in Google?Probably questions like:Why is my computer so slow?How to build a computer?How to speed up a computer?These are all very real problems and people
are looking for solutions.In fact, Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer tells us
that these exact search queries get tens ofthousands of searches each month.Now, the best part about these specific queries
is that you can help people solve their problems,while integrating products from your store 
in the content."Why is my computer so slow" could come down
to a hard drive, CPU, or ram problem.So help your readers diagnose the problem
and offer product solutions within your post."How to build a computer" would be a super
easy plug for any computer components.They're already showing intent to build,so it's unlikely that they've already purchased 
parts and peripherals.Alright, second example.Let's say you're a real estate agent and you're
compensated when someone buys,sells, or rents a property.Now, the thing that most agents do is boast
about how many homes they've soldor how they won an award that you nor I 
have never heard of.My point is that the average buyer or seller doesn't care.And to prove my point, no one is searching
for things like:which realtor won the most awards in New York?But again, potential customers are looking
for solutions to their problems.Problems like:How to invest in real estate?How to buy a house?What credit score is needed to buy a house?And again, these all have the potential to
attract a massive audience.By ranking in Google for something like "how
to invest in real estate,"you're now attracting potential buyers with deep pockets and they likely have intent to buy.Content on "how to buy a house" would likely
require the work of an agent at some point,which could be you."What credit score is needed to buy a house"
is a great way to show that your knowledgeand intentions go beyond making a sale.The best thing about blogging for SEO is that
once you rank, you'll be getting free, consistentand passive traffic from Google.If you're new to SEO, I highly recommend watching
our SEO for beginners video,which will give you a nice overview of what SEO is, 
how it works, and how you can get it to work for you.I'll also link up some additional resources
on doing keyword research that grows trafficand revenue, as well as a video on how to write
a blog post with SEO in mind.For now, let's move on to the second strategy, 
which is to invest in video content,specifically on YouTube.YouTube is the second most visited search 
engine in existence.To top that off, video carousels nearly doubled
in 2017 in Google's search results.Video isn't just the future.It's the present.And the same principle of helping potential
customers works for video too.When people go to video search engines like YouTube,they're looking to find answers to their questions.For example, if you bought a so-called "new"
iPhone X on eBay, you might search for"iPhone X unboxing" and see if all of the contents 
are in the box.And according to Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer,
108,000 searches are happening eachmonth globally on YouTube alone for this keyword.In fact, this video that you're watching right now
was chosen because I can see that people arespecifically looking for digital marketing
tutorials for beginners.To come up with topic ideas that people are
searching for in your niche,head over to Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer, switch the search engine to YouTubeand search for a broad keyword in your niche.Let's use "makeup" as an example.Now, "makeup" as a standalone keyword isn't a problem.So let's go to the Questions report,where you can see popular questions people are searching for on your topic.And right away, you'll see great topic ideas
like "how to clean makeup brushes"and how to cover acne with makeup.Now, when you're creating these videos, try
and keep the fluff out and pack in as muchnecessary value as possible.Doing this has helped us grow our YouTube
views to over 150,000 views per monthand best of all, since all of our videos show
how our SEO tools can help,it's led to thousands of new paying leads and customers,specifically mentioning that they found us through YouTube.Most of our video growth was done through
YouTube SEO, so I'll leave links to a tutorialto help you rank your videos and get more views.Next up is social media marketing.Rather than covering every social media network,
I want to pass on a couple of important tipsthat will help you grow your social channels.The first is to focus on just one social media
channel when you're just starting out.It takes time to build a following.But numbers aren't everything.What you want is a loyal following.When you dip your toes into every possible
social media network out there,your attention gets divided and the results get diluted.So which social media marketing channel do 
you choose?That leads us into the second tip,which is to go where your target audience is 
and cater to the platform.If you have to choose just one social network,it's not about choosing the one with the 
most active users.It's all about understanding the audience
that's there and if you can serve the reasonfor them being there.You really need to think about why someone
is logging into the specific social media network.For example, people usually go to YouTube
to learn how to do something, or to be entertained.But Facebook is different. Think about it.Have you ever logged onto Facebook, hoping
that you would see an unboxing tutorial?Or better yet, have you ever opened your Facebook
app hoping you would find a limited time offerthat's 97% off, only for the next 37 minutes?Probably not.People don't check Facebook with credit card in hand.People like and share things that are helpful,
interesting, shocking or funny.So if you are going to try and bring people
into your world, present your message asa story, video, or something else that will
likely stand out from the endless feedof vacation vanity shots.Pinterest on the other hand is primarily a
social search enginewhere people can control what they want to search for.The primary intent of users on this platform
is to get inspired, learn things, and plan to do things.So create content that caters to their intent 
for being there.So if this is your audience, take advantage
of a less competitive landscape from bothan ads and organic perspective.Speaking of ads, that's the next digital marketing
strategy on the list for today.When it comes to paid advertising, please do not 
throw your money blind into an ad networkbecause you read that it was good.What works for one person won't necessarily
work for the next person.Instead, think about the ABCs of paid advertising.A is for audience, B is for budgetand C is for commerciality.We've already covered the audience part.You want to engage on social networks where
your target audience hangs out.Budget is the next one.Bloomberg reported that Google and Facebook
own a combined 58% of the $111 billion dollar market.Now, the way ads work are usually based on auctions.The more advertisers there are, the more expensive
it gets for you and I.So let's say you're in the ultra competitive
industry of conference calling.If we search for that keyword in Keywords
Explorer with Google set as the search engine,you'll see that the cost per click from Google Ads is $20!If you have an ad budget of let's say $1,000
per month, then you'd only be able to get50 clicks before your budget was depleted.Instead, you can do two things:The first option is to look for keywords that
have a lower cost per click.Just go to the Phrase match report to see
all keywords in our keyword database thatcontain your target keyword.Next, set a filter to only show keywords that
have a maximum cost per clickof something lower like $5.From here, you can filter through the list
and see if there are some more lucrative opportunitiesrather than spending $20 per click.This one for a "conference call app" might
be a good one since it's a quarter of the price.Another benefit is that the reason behind
the searcher's query is more clear.Someone searching for this is clearly looking
for an app that does conference calls,whereas someone searching for just "conference 
call" could be looking for many different things.The second thing you can do is experiment
with less popular ad platformswhere your target audience might be.Finally is commerciality.Now, all major ad platforms are able to bring
ROI for their advertisers.Otherwise, they wouldn't exist.But you have to find a way to bridge the gap
between the intent of the platformand how you monetize your products.And the solution is going to be content.For example, let's say you sell boutique furniture
and think that Pinterest will be a good platformto run some ads.In my opinion, it wouldn't be a good idea
to advertise a bunch of links to high-endfurniture like couches and dining tables.Instead, blog posts could work really well
here since people log on to Pinterest mainlyto get inspired, and learn new things.Here's what that bridge might look like.Pinterest ads would be the discovery tool.You pay them money and they'll show your pin.The bridge would then be a helpful blog post
on let's say, "11 Interior Design Tips ForYour Living Room That Won't Break the Bank."And within that content, you could showcase your products where it supports the tip you're speaking of.Nail the ABCs of paid ads, and increase your
chances of actually converting your hard earneddollars into ROI.Next up is one of my favorites and that's podcasts.Now, there are two ways to look at podcasts.First is to create your own and the second
is to be interviewed on someone else's podcast.Creating your own podcast can be great for
brand and building an audience.But if you're just starting out, it can take
quite a bit of time to get any sort of traction.Getting interviewed on podcasts is a different story.Podcasters are always looking for interesting
people to interview.Even if you don't have a ton of experience
in the online world, your offline experiencesand expertise could be a great way to land
yourself a position on a popular podcast.Now, if you don't know which podcasts you
should approach, an easy way to find opportunitiesis to look at your favorite podcasts and find
someone in your industry that has been interviewed.Looking at the podcast page for Entrepreneur 
on Fire, you'll see this episode with Jim Kwik.Now, if we click through to the interview,
you'll notice two things.The first is that the guest's name is in the title.This is very common for podcast interviews.Second is the link on the page.The host will almost always link to the guest's
home page in the show notes.Knowing this, we can use a tool like Ahrefs'
Site Explorer to find all podcasts they'vebeen interviewed on.So I'll enter in jimkwik.com and I'll also
set the search mode to a URL search so wecan find pages that are linking specifically
to the homepage.Once the overview page loads, go to the backlinks
report, which will show you all of the pagesthat are linking to this URL.Finally, let's use the Include search and
type in Jim Kwik.And to keep our results super relevant, I'm
going to set the filter to search for hisname only in the titles of the referring pages.And we now have around 120 podcasts we can
pitch to get interviewed.So filter through relevant podcasts, and pitch
the host as to why they should interview youand the value you can give to their audience.Next on the list is email marketing.If you've ever looked into email marketing,then you've probably heard people claiming 
that "email is king."But I promise you that once you get into it,
you'll quickly discover that it's not as turnkeyas online gurus make it sound.And don't get me wrong.Email marketing is great.But first, you need traffic to get email subscribers.It also requires opt-in forms to turn a visitor
into a subscriber.In my opinion, email is a great long play
to build connection with your audience andand even sell high ticket items.So my tip for you on email marketing is quite simple:First, focus on building your email list from day one.It's important and you might as well collect
emails from interested people from the start,even if it's not a substantial list.But be realistic with your goals and as you build
your audience, put more time into your emaillist and see how it can serve your business.The final strategy is to use forums and 
community boards.Community forums like Quora, Reddit, and Facebook
are great promotion channels.But before you go off and start posting links
to your product pages,there are a few things you need to understand.And these are all based around the unspoken
rules of spam.First: don't promote your products or services
pages within these groups.The intent of users on these platforms is to learn.Not to be sold to directly.Instead, think of these networks as a place
to share your expertise,build relationships and help others.Second: use links to your content sparingly.If you're constantly posting links to your
blog and have justified in your head thatthat this is non-promotional, then you're most 
likely wrong.Links can be more appropriate based on the
network you're posting on.For example, Quora generally has longer answers,and linking to your content where it supports your point is a good idea.Facebook groups on the other hand are a different
story.Let's say you're a real estate agent and you
join a "first time homebuyers" group on Facebook.If someone asks a question like:
"I'm looking to buy my first home and waswondering if I can even get a mortgage?"Now, if every agent on that group posts links to their website,can you see how spammy that could get?Instead, it would make sense to post a link
to someone else's affordability calculatorsor offer introductions to b-lenders.The point is that helping first will go a
lot farther than self-promotional contentthat can taint your reputation.Now, I'd love to hear from you.Which digital marketing strategy do you think

marketing changes fast which is why inthis episode I'm going to be breaking
down 5 of the absolute most importantdigital marketing skills you need to
master if you want to stay on top ofyour game. Let's get to it!Hey there my name is Adam Erhart,
marketing strategist and welcome to TheMarketing Show. Alright, so it really is
no secret that the world of digitalmarketing changes at an absolutely crazy
fast pace and what works today may notwork tomorrow, what worked last week
might not be working today and and so onand so forth. This is why it's incredibly
important to make sure to stay on top ofyour game by consuming content like this,
engaging in other people's content,making sure that you're putting your own
strategies and your own tactics to thetest and sort of analyzing the data,
seeing what works and what doesn't sothat you can stay ahead of the curve,
always getting the best results possible.It's funny, actually, looking back over my
career and over the last many years ofdoing all kinds of different digital
marketing from web design and SEO, movingthrough paid ads and social and content
strategy and essentially, just howdifferent the stuff that we're using
today inside the agency is, compared tothe stuff that we were doing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7 years ago. I mean it's almostcompletely different now. Attention spans
are shorter. There's new technology. Theway that customers and clients engage
with content online, it's almostcompletely different. So, the stuff that
kind of got you to this point, isn'tgoing to be the things that are going to
take you forward into the next decade.And that's what this video is all about.
Alright, so let's get things startedwith what I believe is probably one of
the most important skills that you needto master which is: Marketing
Fundamentals. Now, I've spoken about thisbefore in my what is digital marketing
video. If you haven't seen that yet, I'llmake sure to link it up in the cards as
well as the description below. Butessentially, digital marketing is just
marketing done digitally. I know, it's notreally profound but at the end of the
day that's really what it is. This is whyit's really important if you want to
succeed with digital marketing to makesure that you're dedicating and
allocating a sufficient amount of timeto really mastering the basics of
marketing, those fundamental principleslike positioning and differentiation and
all the points around branding and howto really build kind of a solid and
likable brand for today's day and age.I really can't stress this enough. It is
absolutely, fundamentally, crucial thatyou understand the basics of marketing
and fortunately, once you sort of gutthese into your system, once you've spent
some time learning them and reallytrying to master them, here's the beauty,
this time is going to be really wellspent because human behavior, which is
essentially really what marketing is, isunderstanding and leveraging different
aspects of human behavior, how you cansort of I want to say manipulate but
essentially, influence the direction andthe decisions people make, well,
regardless, human behavior really hasn'tchanged all that much. At the end of the
day, we're still just people. This means,by even understanding the basics of how
people work and how they make buyingdecisions, well, you're gonna be able to
apply this information this year, nextyear, for the next 5-10 probably the next
hundred years. For example, by spending alittle bit of time learning about
consumer behavior, marketing fundamentals,you'll probably come across the fact
that consumers make buying decisionsemotionally, not logically or irrationally,
this doesn't mean that you don't want toinclude logical or rational elements, it
just means that you want to lead withthe emotional aspect first so you can
sort of get that buy-in and get thatconviction and then follow up with the
logical and rational elements of yourproduct or service, so that you can allow
them to justify the decision tothemselves and to others. The beauty is
that once you understand that onevery simple concept, it's really never
going to change and it's going to beable to be applied to all of your future
marketing making it all that much moreeffective moving forward. If you'd like a
bit of a refresh on marketing basics andessentially, foundational marketing
principles, I'll make sure to link up avideo on that in the cards and in the
description box below as well that youcan check out right after this one. Alright, the next skill that you're goingto want to master, moving forward, is: to
Focus on Conversation Generation. Now, asa die-hard proponent of direct response
marketing which is really all aboutgenerating those leads and getting them
to take action as soon as possible, well,a big element or a big switch that we've
been seeing lately is sort of atransition from straight-up lead gen to
conversation gen because at the end ofthe day you can generate all the leads
you want but what you probably want arethose conversations that are going to
lead to bigger and more essentially,buying opportunities for your business.
Now yes, lead genis still very much alive and still very
much a part of the stuff that I consulton and the stuff that we do inside the
agency. But, if you really want to takeyour marketing to the next level and
really master it, you're gonna want tofocus on that next step which is
essentially, turning those leads intoconversations. Now, it's a bit of kind of
give-and-take here about what you'rewilling to sacrifice on the front end
and how valuable a lead is compared to aconversation and that's kind of a whole
other discussion but what I want to makesure you understand here, is that when
you're structuring your marketingcampaigns, you really want to think a
little bit further down the funnel andreally concentrate on not just
generating that lead but turning it intoa conversation. But, more on funnel
marketing in just a minute here. Now,here's a bit of a prediction. You see,
over the last couple years we've beenseeing a ton of people flood the scenes
with lead gen services and all sorts ofdifferent agencies and consultants
offering traffic generating leadgenerating services like running
Facebook ads or YouTube ads or basically,anything to get leads. But, where you've
got an opportunity to really shine,whether it's as an agency or as a
business owner or entrepreneur, is reallythinking further than that and again
focusing on those conversations becausegenerating traffic really isn't that
hard, it really just comes down tofinding the right people that you're
trying to get in front of having theright offer message that you can sort of
work around to make sure it'sirresistible and then choosing the right
media source, whether it's Facebook adsor Instagram ads or YouTube or whatever.
So, traffic is pretty much everywhere butwhat isn't everywhere is the skill or
the art or the ability to take thattraffic and actually convert it into a
conversation that gets somebodyinterested in doing business with you.
Alright, so the next skill that you'regoing to want to master moving forward
is something that I alluded to justearlier, which is: Full Funnel Marketing.
Essentially, what you want to do here isbe aware and be cognizant of the entire
customer journey, both, pre sale and ofcourse post sale. But, that's something
entirely different. Rather, what I reallywant you to do is, when you're running
your marketing campaigns, think aboutevery step that a customer prospect or
potential customer is going to have totake in order to, essentially, become a
paying client or customer with yourbusiness. Now, obviously this is going to
involve some element of lead gen whichis that very top of the funnel, that cold
traffic, the people that have no ideawho you are or what you do or why they
should even care. But, I want you to thentake it a step further and focus on the
warm traffic. You see, essentially onceyou've generated that lead, how are you
gonna take that lead and turn it into aconversation and then for bonus marks,
take it a step further, how are you gonnatake that conversation and move it from
warm traffic to hot traffic by actuallygetting them to take their credit card
out of their wallet and become a payingcustomer. Now, I know that's a lot of
stuff to think about and if you've neverreally come across marketing funnels or
sales funnels before, I appreciate it's alot to take in so I'll make sure to link
up a video on marketing funnels as wellas one on sales funnels again in the
cards and the description below soyou're gonna be able to check those out
right after this video too. The main pointthat I really want to leave you with
here, though, is that really marketingisn't siloed or isolated, it's not just
one element of either generating trafficor doing lead gen or even generating
conversations. But rather, I want you tothink about the entire marketing funnel
from that very first moment that someonegets introduced to you and to your
business, all the way through to thepoint that they become a paying customer
or client. And then again, if you wanteven more bonus marks, think about all
the touch points that are gonna happenafter they become an actual paying
client or customer, how can you reallymake sure you're delivering a phenomenal
experience that's going to lead tobetter retention, better customer loyalty
and more ratings and reviews andreferrals for your business. Alright, so
the next skill that you're gonna wannamaster, is probably no surprise and
should probably, hopefully, be prettyobvious but it's worth saying anyways
because still not enough people arededicating the time, energy and resources
to this phenomenally powerful tool andthat is: Video Marketing. You see, when it
comes to marketing your business andwhen it comes to really building on that
know like and trust factor, well, nothingreally beats face-to-face communication.
The ability to sit down, look someone inthe eye, have a conversation, understand
where they're coming from and how or ifyour business is even able to help. But,
obviously getting face to face withevery single one of your potential
prospects or customers, well, might behard, might even be impossible which is
where video steps in and it really isthe next best thing, because it allows
you to not only hear someone's voice butyou can see their face, you can read
their facial expressions, you can try tojudge, whether they're coming off as
take or genuine or fake and salesy kindof slimy. The other thing with video is
that it allows you to build a ton oftrust very quickly because again, short
of being in person and really able toread the body language and and hear the
inflections and the tone of voice andthe style and all that, well, it really is
the next best thing in getting all ofthose messages across. Plus, you're able
to cram in a ton of value and a ton ofinformation very quickly.
For example, if picture is worth athousand words, well, then a video might
be worth a million words because you'reable to imply all sorts of different
nonverbal cues and again, all of thosethings that come down to style and tone
and pace and so on. Now, here's the funnything with video, if you're not doing it
already, you probably know you should bedoing it and even if you're already
doing it, you probably know you should bedoing more. But, what is it that stops
most people from getting involved andreally cranking out more video. Well, the
answer is pretty simple and it reallycomes down to this myth or this mistaken
belief that everything with video needsto be perfect. Now, this is understandable.
After all, we've sort of been raised andbrought up watching really polished and
really perfected videos through TV showsand movies and basically, any kind of
media we see on the screen. But thingshave changed and essentially, the
barriers to entry to creating video, havecome way down and we're really kind of
tired and almost sick of overly polishedand Hollywood type productions,
especially if they're coming from abusiness or from somebody that you kind
of want to engage with. In fact, in a lotof cases we've done a number of
different studies testing a reallyhighly produced incredibly expensive
video against something shot with justan iPhone that really is pretty low
budget and when it comes to running themas ads against the target market, the
low-budget one often just absolutelydestroys the really expensive high
budget one. Now, this isn't to say thatthere's not a time and a place for a
really beautiful really polished pieceof video media. But it shouldn't be the
obstacle. You shouldn't let perfectionismget in the way of you just really
getting out there filming something andpublishing it. Plus, the other benefit of
video is that you can mess up a wholebunch of stuff and then just edit it out.
And nobody will ever know. Alright, andmoving on to the fifth digital marketing
skill that you need to master is:Automation. And after all, there is so
much to do and so little timeand this is where automation steps in as
a very valuable skill, both for yourselfand for your own business. But also,
potentially to offer to clients orcustomers to help them automate some of
their business. Essentially, automation isthe offloading or the delegation or
basically using tools and technology andsoftware to take care of a lot of the
repetitive tasks that you don't need tobe doing, probably shouldn't be doing, in
your business but that still need to getdone. What this means is that you're able
to get a whole lot more done, a whole lotquicker
and in fact, in some cases you're able toget a whole lot more done pretty much
instantly because the automation can beset up ahead of time to just run behind
the scenes and trust me, it's a lotfaster than any human being could ever
hope to be. For example, in one of mymarketing agencies, we can generate a
lead for a client using Facebook Ads, wecan take that lead we can nurture them
with SMS and text and email and voicemail and essentially, start the
conversation from our end and follow upwith a very strategic sort of automated,
follow-up sequence, right up until we getthat response and then from there, it
gets even further automated so that wecan nurture them again
and turn that conversation into afull-fledged client. And we can do this
all on behalf of the client without theclient needing to lift a finger, which is
magic. And that's the power of automation.It's essentially, like having a full
sales team or a full marketing team or afull appointment setting team or
whatever you need to do, working for you24/7 365 all the time without you
needing to do anything once that initialwork has been put in and the automation
is set up. But, even if you don't want toget that fancy with automation, it's
still a valuable thing to master and toincorporate into your business and you
can still use it to do some basic, butincredibly important things, such as
sending out automated email newslettersthat go out whenever somebody downloads
your guide or buys one of your products.Automated re-targeting and re-marketing advertisements that follow someonearound like a creepy stalker. Anytime
they visit your website, automatedcustomer management that follows up with
customers and makes them feel cared forand looked out for. Even if it's a robot
doing it. And, people like robots anyway.Even automated grocery shopping which
yes, is not marketing related but itstill saves me a ton of time. The point
is, that using technology andautomating repetitive and really often
boring processthis can save you a ton of time and make
you that much more effective andefficient and really getting the work
done that needs to be done so you canget back to doing those high leverage,
really valuable activities that aregoing to drive your business forward. Alright, the next thing you're going towant to do is check out the video I have
linked up right here on 20 digitalmarketing tactics which is going to give
you a ton more great ideas to reallydrive your marketing forward. So make
sure to check that out now. Thanks somuch for watching and I'll catch you
next time, on the Marketing Show. Pointsto consider when you're constructing an
