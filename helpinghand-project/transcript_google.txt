what's up everybody how's it goin inthis video I paired up with my friendCamille who goes by the name Erik tohonline and we decided to do a codinginterview where I interviewed him overGoogle Hangouts on a Google Doc now thecool thing about this is that Erik toeor Camille is a competitive programmerhe is super good at the types ofproblems that coding interviews test youon he was I think second place at theGoogle Code Jam competition back in 2018he has his own YouTube channel whichI'll put a link to in the description incomments below and you might have evenseen him in a video interview of him onYouTube that a month ago and got a tonof views so I think this video is gonnabe really insightful because you'll beable to see how someone like him who'sso good at coding interview problemsapproaches and solves a problem in realtime under pressure I want to add butthis is exactly the type of codinginterview that you could expect to getat a big tech company like Google Iinterviewed dozens of candidates atGoogle and this is really how I conductinterviews minus the fact that here Iknow Camille so maybe there were a fewmoments where you know we exchanged alittle bit of banter that I wouldn't dootherwise with a real candidate but itreally is how I conduct interviews so Ithink you'll find it valuable on top ofthat the question here is a very hardone it's actually a question that wehave on algo expert by the way if you'repreparing for coding interviews checkout algo expert audio my company usesthe promo code cleanse elem for adiscount on the platform but so it'll bereally interesting for you to see howCamille solved this problem in a waythat I had actually never seen before atthe end of the video we have a shortdebrief session where we talked abouthow the interview went and on top ofthat I just filmed a very smallcommentary that I added in the middle ofthe interview just to kind of share mythoughts about how he did during thefirst half of the interview with thatenjoy the video okay so Camille I juststarted the 45-minute timer and we'regonna dive right into the codinginterview question so I want you toimagine an XY coordinate plane rightyou've got the x-axis you've got they-axis and you've got coordinates on theplane does that make sense so far didokay and I can handle two dimensions youcan edit you can handle two dimensionsso I we've we've like 11 need to becomes right up until 10 it's okay but at11 it becomes difficult exactlyso I'm gonna give you a list of XYcoordinates to Cartesian coordinatecoordinates on the plane and I want youto write a function that is gonna tellme how many rectangles are formed on theplane by these coordinates so forinstance if I give you this you see howI copy/paste it like six dots right youcan imagine that the the XY axes aremaybe like here at the the left sidethat's the y axis and then the the xaxis it doesn't really matter and youcould imagine that here there are threerectangles that are formed right there'sone that's sort of like this firstsquare there are two squares the leftone the right one and there is the bigrectangle the big rectangle exactly so Iwant you to write a function that takesin these points and that tells me howmany rectangles there are there are twolittle caveats first of all a rectanglehas to have four corners on the on theplane to be considered a rectangle sofor instance if I delete this one thenyou lose quite a see I think you youlose two of the rectangles and and thenthe second thing is for now we're justgonna deal with rectangles that areparallel to the X and Y axis yes sothere this was going to me rightquestion what would happen if I addedaround here and now would that this fourpoints would they create a correct anglethat I should count so friendly I guessfor now we don't for now we don't andnow we don't okay well I don't know ifyou're aware of that but I'm quite goodin computational geometry so it's up toyou if you want to leave this problem asit islet's leave the problem as it is andwe'll see if we can improve it soonthat's right okay so we want you want tocount rectangles made of fourfarce of points from here they should beparallel to access I guess theprofessional work for that is like eyesoptic if there is a word for that Idon't remem yeah there is one word andit's something with eye anyway I wouldsay that we're looking for suchquadruples X I X Y then the other pointhas the same carrier decks but differentwhy does some different X Y X 2 y 2 yesand now I I will also make my screenbigger and we are looking for far ofsoft points like that where accent x2are different because otherwise we wouldcount the degenerated rectangles of likezero area yeah and Y is not y2 and thisis our goal what makes sense is toiterate for sure otherwise one point soI'm not yet sure what I'm going to dofully but some pseudocode would be thatI iterate over one point in points andthis will be my accent Y right if I wasable for example to iterate over thesecond point with the same X in bruteforce way it would be P let's say abovein point as well if px is equal P abovedot X and not to over count somethinglet's make this P above to be indeedabove so y-coordinate will be bigger ifthat then we continue and what I foundis a pair of points that is one is aboveeach other like this path right and Ineed to find matching pair that is onthe same level if here I would justincrease some counterby one I would count like vertical linesthat can be created and instead here Iwill say that what matters our variablesP Y and B above y also I hope thatwriting in C++ like count is fine let'sstart with Anyawe have P Y and P up of Y I want tocount the number of other pairs thatproduce the same pair my idea is to hereincrease the count for a pair P Y Pabove Y where this is say a map or ahash map for now in C++ I would startwith a head I'm up from pair to hintright called it countthis is count our wipers like this waythis way and this way coordinated rightkind of count vertical lines this wouldgive me logarithm in complexity what Icould also do is put a hash map here anunordered map and then to make it workin C++ I would need to define some hashvalue of a map I think it isn't there bydefault at least in C++ but for now itisn't important for the logic this way Icount that and maybe just before I wouldsay unsurfaced equal count of upside sonot to repeat something I will assumingthat coordinates are in this pair of Y Iwill make per divide the abovewhy let's not make it ugly and hereincrease the answer by count of that andincrease the count of despair so babiesway firstthis was sorry to cut you off just tojust to make sure that I'm followingcorrectly basically you are iteratingthrough all the points here then for allthe other points they're looking forpoints that are directly above ityour your if statement right and hereyou're saying okay I've got one verticalline and which is this pair and thenyou're gonna say we're gonna count allthe other vertical lines that areexactly on the same levelyeah and thanks to the fact that I do itin this order at this moment for linewith a surplus equal I up to the answerthe number of pairs that the verticallines that were already processed andthen only I increase the count by one soif it happens that first I some pairappears then for a moment discount is 0so it is answer plus equal to 0 onlythen I increase the count by one and iflater on the left or right doesn'tmatter for nowlet's say this will be used the accountwill be I mean count is already one andthen I get answer plus equal one when Iget to this second vertical like thatI'm not sure about this whoever maybe Idouble count like when I'm on left lineI count the right one and the other waybut then I think this is disorderdisorder prevents from that why does theorder whenever I meet the first paironly then I increase the count by oneand later no matter if the other Parison the left or right I will increase theanswer by one right I see are you whenyou are when you are look when you're Iguess we should we should explore whatthis make pair function looks like rightyeah it's just at Apple because this isorders I didn'tthen we should oh I see I see Isis isalso correct just I could paste thathere and there and that's it it's justnot to repeat code right okay okay okayso okay so key so keep going keep goingfrom here then yeah and I think this waythose two for loops together theyiterate over all the pairs ofthis way I check if I have a verticalline so here if I wanted to print thosethat were herethis thing could print all the verticallines but I don't want to print I wantto count pairs of those vertical linesthat are on the same levelI see vertical line is defined by pair Yand I want to count bars that are sinelike some alternative for that would bejust to do this like not to increaseanswer here and later if I know thatthere are say 10 pairs on the same levelI could use some simple math formula tosay what is the number of rectanglesfrom that I think it would be time tostew which is like 10 times 9/2 right Ifind this one to be more elegant andhere answer all right you do have theanswer from here now I now I understandwhat you're doing at first for somereason I thought the make pair you wereright that was a function and forgive myc++ I thought that was a function youwere kind of going through and countingall the pairs now I understand so waitthis walked me through them this examplebecause because yes you're right becauseof the ordering of when you incrementthe count it works because you arebasically you're only ever going to finda rectangle when you are on the rightside of that rectangle right exactlyassuming that I go four points from leftto right and the cool thing is thatthanks to this order like I don'tactually care left or right I count itwhen I meet the latter of two verticallines which is in whichever order I goright like if I went through a set ofnumbers say 5 7 5 2 4 2 7 5 and I wantedto count pairs of equal numbers I couldgo do that from left to right and forevery like this 5 add to the answer thenumber of already 5s in the set but if Idid that in some scrambled order like 5to 7 5 5 and so on it would be the samething all rightand indeed let's go through the exampleit it is sometimes dangerous but for nowlet's say that the order is like thatbut my color doesthird points and I claimed that theorder does it matter if I do it likethat and first B is 1 then the onlyactually PF non-p above will be validhere because I'm looking at point thatis above but you would never get an Ayou skipped the F statement would nevernever pass exactly this would be neverbe satisfied but when P is 2 when thisis the second point on your drawing thenhere 1 will be a valid point above yathe x-coordinate is same py so secondpoint is below why I assume thaty-coordinate grows up so this is truethen I go here we create a pair of waitcoordinates that are like this y andthen that way yeah and first your mapfirst has just zeros as values yet sothis does nothing and in some languagesI would maybe need to put explicitly 0here but the purpose it isn't importantthat's final and then I say there is avertical line like that if you everagain meet vertical line that is withexactly the same word y above and belowthen you have a rectangle from thatright ok so this is what happened thecount of this pair of wise is 1 and whathappens later when P is 4 then P aboveus free again will satisfy the conditionbefore that if P is free nothing isabove yet so Michael shouldn't findanything here yepyeah the work done we do the pair Y isthe same Paris before because the Ycreates our side yeah so this will doanswer plus equal 1 and then we increasecount even more so how it becomes 2 yetwas one before I think there is that'snow County stir and eventually when weare at five not five six five nothinghappens again this one is five exactlyso five is skipped and four six and fivethe same pair of wise is their answer isplus equal additional two and latercount would be increased even more tofree yeah but I don't care about itanymore because that's it and the answeris sick guys free one plus two as weexpectedokay so if I wanted to be more carefulwith that I would just check on so whathappens in a different order I guessyeah that's what I was gonna ask doesthis break if your thing is the thing isI never compare x coordinate like if Isay that this is one two three and fourmy countlike the first pair that will beencountered will be this one and twojust in different orderyeah but in the the below is 1 this oneis 2 but what happens here with answerand count is the same thing nothing isdifferent at all the y coordinate ourdesign hereI do not compare X never so I don'tdistinguish and it just about the orderand a pair one two I will increase thecount by one for free for later theanswer will be increased by one thanksto them yeah yeah yeah so in sum I don'tcare what order I go for all thevertical lines and also for each newvertical line I need the number ofprevious vertical lines that were at thesame level above and below right so I'mquite confident now with this solutionand the complexity will be an x + 4because there are two for loops if n isthe number of points x insidepessimistically every time i can goinside the safeI guess it's possible if everything ison one vertical line and here is a mapthat in C++ is lock so this thing is ofN squared times log of N and well log ofn square but this is in math the same aslog of n it's all a constant like twogoes before the law guard the marketthat is comparative law Gert yeah okayLagarde miss coming from C++ map well Ithink some other languages already havethat by default constant yes about justchanging this to unordered map andwriting some small piece of code to tohandle pairs there xe+ persisted aboutit sir yeah yeah we don't we don't needtime to get into that I and here we go iI have n square solution for now I haveno idea how I would speed this up if Ineed or should I think about it I'm notsure though I don't think we can we needto go to that I'm not sure that youcould mainly because you ultimately likethere's a worst case where therectangles are let's say all on the sameline and any any ops or sorry not therectangles all the points are all in thesame line and any optimization that youmight try to do you would end up havingto iterate through every point and forevery point iterating through everyother point I don't think that you coulddo better than N squared let's not diveinto that as far as space complexityit's also so o of and I think here rightbecause you would have what do I put Ihave a map the with those percentsspecifically of all the purse will bedifferent so for even a bunch of nrandom points I have an square so writeN squared because you have very fewtimes okay so I think there there mightbe a way to improve the space weactually have a solution on on algoexpert for this problem with oath andspace but I don't think that that'ssuper interesting here I'm not tooconcerned about that we can talk aboutthat maybe later what I do want toexplore since we do have time if youstill have like 25 minutes you have 27minutes super quick pause I just want toshare my thoughts on the first half ofthe interview as you saw Camille didvery well as far as the coding andalgorithm design part of the interviewis concerned he came up with a solutionthat was very good he did it very fasthe was able to actually code it out toreally fantastic job on his part fromthat point of view the one little pieceof constructive criticism that I wouldgive here is that he was so good at thisthat he kind of forgot to communicate alittle bit more his thought processsince I had never seen the solution thathe actually came up with I kind of gotlost in the middle you kind of saw thatwhen when I wasn't quite following whathe was saying and I had to kind of catchup to him and so here I think that hejust could have communicated a tiny bitmore voiced his thought process a tinybit more but otherwise he did afantastic job and now as you'll seeduring the second half of the interviewthis is where I really tried tochallenge him with something much harderand this is something that interviewerswill often do when they're dealing withsuch a strong candidate they'll givethem a problem or a tougher variation ofthe current problem that they don't evenexpect the candidate to find a solutionto they just kind of want to see howdoes this candidate who's obviouslyreally good deal with a complex problemsomething that they're probably notgoing to be able to solve and so this iswhat you're about to see and going Iwant to explore what we said at thebeginning of what if now we haverectangles that are that can be diagonalso something like this let's put youknow seven eight nine whoops and herelike you pointed out there's a rectanglethere's for example this one yeah I'llput it in reverse something that issmart tilted that isn't very irregularso that the viewers can understand whatwe mean yes exactly what you said thisrectangle in green here is sort ofdiagonal it's not horizontal or verticalor whatever the word is and how do youcompute that so this is part that maybenormally I would need to think about butI'm good in computational geometry so Iknow what are like the vectors and crossproducts thatand the thing is that then like beforewe could define this way when I've wentfour points create a rectangle now weneed to modify that quite a lot I willjust move the first solution below towork here with example more that iflet's say for a moment that the firstpoint of a rectangle is zero zero yeahwe can later put something morecomplicated here and then if the otheris X Y and some third point is x2 y2then if if those two are neighbors ofzero zero then I want a right anglebetween them the 90 degrees right andthere is a formula for that that iscross product it will be x times y 2 isequal Y times X 2 which basically isalso possible to figure out withoutknowing the terms because I rememberthat I used to like when I neededsomething like that and I didn't knowthe formula I would just draw an exampleI have such a rectangle a right angleand if you put like point five one thenyou try to match which point wouldcreate indeed a right angle and then yousee that like that for example the 1 5so this is that point and minus 5 1those two would create a right anglewith 0 0 and from that you can figureout what needs to be called all right ifyou put it this way the distance doesn'tmatter so that's one part now I'malready able with formula to count theright triangles I need triangles thathave the right angle right so it onehalf of the right angle yeah what do weneedI think this pink allows me for first oftwo the fork solution where I woulditerate over all the first of pointsand I would check some formulas so Ineed to check the right angles plus someother thing or maybe I yeah if I checkall the far angles then that's itbecause something that has four sidesand four right angles I think is arectangle yeah I wanted to say that Ialso checked some distances but itdoesn't sound necessary and so that thatwould be just for loop polit I found apoint B for loop point C for the D ifand here a lot of ifs for those for thisstuff Plus this doesn't have to be zerozero band then I can shift the drawingto put the point in zero zero okaysubtract things or just think about thevectors not about points about vectorsthat decides for now do I go in thecorrect directionso it's interesting because I'veactually never done I've not reallynever solved this version of the problemI just had it in the back of my mind asa way to like making this problem muchmore difficult that I wanted to explorewith you but I don't know how to solvethis problem so I'm finding itinteresting that you're going with thisapproach in my mind I was thinking maybewe could solve it by by figuring outlike that you need you need the samelike rise over run right you need thesame what's it what's the name of thatslope slope yeah I haven't done math andso on in the same slope on off on likethe two parallel sides and you know so Imight I might want to try that in amoment because I don't know where I'mgoing by the way if if I got somethingvery hard and in that I would bestressed then also I would take thatlike five minutes of thinking beforejumping into like going for everythingright even with the first version Itried to just not make a pause in theinstead to just dive into itI thought that yeah I will likely get agood complexity here I'm are like blindand we'll see where it goes so I canthink later about like what to put herebut I am able to check for the rightangle if you ask me later I will callsome fork or something for that it usesthis formula right but then like onetechnique I like for speeding up on themiddle solution if you have a lot ofPhillips is to just remove the last forloop and the thing is if you have threepoints and they create a right angle youshould know where the fourth point isyeah that's true and like because if youdecide they are a ABCD in this orderthen vector a B let's call let's mark itthis way is equal to vector side D seethe two sides are parallel and equal sovectors are the same but even and evenlike just to put it even in simplerterms without even vectors like if youhave three points then you can deducethe x and y coordinate of the fourthpoint based on those three points rightyeah yeah we've some like computationwith coordinates yeah so here that inother words is B minus a is d minus C soI get the is C plus B minus a what meansthat point D is C dot X plus B dot Xminus radio docks come out the same forY and this this must be point D and tocheck if such a point exists I can use ahash map hash that actually it's just tocheck if something exists at thatposition yeah of course one more thingto keep in mind no I got rid of that onemore thing to keep in mind just likewith previous solution is not to overcount something like I don't want tocount the same rectangle four times orif I understand that I do at the end Ican divide the answer before printing byfar in when counting is done not onwhiteboard but with like computer then Iwould usually implement something seethe answer and if it's the big/ whatever I need to / right here aftercoding some code for this I would justanalyze it to see if I overcome then Iwill handle like just like with previousproblems right and we have now n cubebut to go to go even fasteryeah the question is like is there wayto make again I think we established inthe first solution that I don't thinkthere's a way to beat N squared I don'tthink you can beat polynomial time forfor this problem but can we get that andQ down to N squared with the diagonaldiagonal expansion thing I I have someideas one is what you set about slopewell it wasn't my idea but this issomething let's call it idea numberthree slope and Sam tomorrow our firstone is from points a and B figure outwhere C should be so get rid also ofthis for loop right if you have n to behere then C should be somewhere on thisline but it would be hard like I cannotiterate over that C and the thing is thething is here in the example that wehave we're dealing with actually a veryedge case example where I would say yesyes it can be tilted tomorrow we knowthat yes so that's something secondthing is this is something that I wouldI would never come up without sayingfirst that we can consider the middlepoint of segment say I see yeah thiswill be a crazy idea but it might justworkthe the thing is if I see is diagonal ofthis rectangle then I can iterate overall the pairs of points consider heymaybe this is diagonal of a rectanglewhat are what are the properties ofdiagonals of rectangles that areinteresting you they always I think isthey think is that two diagonalsintersect exactly in the middle they doright yeah I it is possible that what Iwill get from this approach from thisidea is not a rectangle but let's I ramprhombus I don't know words in Englishright because there are other shapeswhere the there are other shapes worththe two diagonals intersect in themiddle that are not rectangles right Iwould need to think now we're getting isalike but there might be a way to likefind these these I'm gonna call themhacky solutions that rely on theunderlying like math principles but Iwonder if like I wonder it's an ideanumber one or number three that's sortof more accessible in a way I feel likethere's two is very random and youcannot just get that by thinking I justremembered that I saw some problem thatuses this right maybe even this problemto be honest because some of them aresimilar so let's investigate one orthree I think one in three are actuallykind of similar right it's the idea thatyou you've got the first two pointsmaybe you use the fact that they have agiven slope how do you find C and then Dfrom there yeah okay so I I will try abecause I will try the first one becauseit was my idea maybe I can manage tosolve this problem later I can try slopeso four points a and B figure out whereit's you should be I I'm not able toiterate over C belike then I have iteration of our threepointsmaybe tomorrow Isis in some very magicway I don't think soinstead I would I would write down somethoughts made so let me denote vector Vbut denote from A to B then that V primedenote vector of direction directionperpendicular to V so from thisdirection I would get this one and Iknow C must be somewhere around there amonk points C that are on Direction VPrime from a yes I so from a I want togo along that direction like notnecessarily within the same distance Vprime is just like perpendiculardirection yeah necessarily within somedistance I want to count those that havea matching point D such that C DS isso if from A to B I went let's say twounits up then also from that C that issomewhere elseI want to go to means up yeah but to behonest to be honest Camille I think hereI think you just you just did it the keyis the perpendicular if you can find theperpendicular ones in like constant timeor something you've got your solutionbecause once you find all the points Con the perpendicular vector then D isjust a matter of storing all the pointsin a hashmap and finding the D that hasthe correct XY coordinates right thatfourth point worried about very strangetests where maybe like I think I am ableto find quickly those C but if I iterateover those to see what should be thematching D I think then the complexitiesand again and cubed let's try anywayneed that so I will say that too much tosit to find those see what I do is forevery point a in points point a inpointsfor point c in points and now this willbe let's call it deer map from from atApple that contains a and get vector offrom A to C for a moment let's say plusplus just to count all right and thisget vector it should not only computethe vector like from A to C but also Icare about Direction not about distancethere is a way to handle that like let'ssay I create a vector function yeahdon't point A to point C then X is CXminus I X Y we see Y minus y this is thevector but I I don't want to distinguishvector 1 1 from vector 1010 I care aboutdirection right don't think here wouldbe to compute the angle but that'salways a bad idea because of precisionissue stuff like that but in short it'sgood to take its to normalize this waybut don't you want to distinguish you dowant to distinguish them no waitthe thing is I will finish that in onesecond okay there's a return point madeof x over G and Phi over G and this isnot working for zeroes or negativefurther the thing isI I will use it for that for a I want tofind all the points see that are in thisdirection let's say in Direction one onebut also point that is 10 10 from hereis okay I care about direction that theexample would be that side that B isminus 1 1 is 0 0 so now I'm looking forall the points that are like the thevalid point C are like 5 5 13 13 and soon my house will create this is left upthis is right up I want to find all ofthose and if I don't do that then in amap I would start only a point 1 1 likeI want to those are fine too so after Ido my think we've got vector I will movethe whole thing to another page to haveit on me like in one place yeah after Ihave this deer map link when I iterateover a litter it over B then I can dowhat I wrote down above that that Vprime denote a vector Directionperpendicular to V so I do that withsome formulas the right the prime isperpendicular of from A to B somethingand then I read deer map actuallyperpendicular of get vector Phi B so getvector finds me a normalized vectorbetween a and B perpendicular rotated by90 degrees and then here use deer mapfrom a with this direction right becausethat will now find all those that arehere yeah for now I'm not even close tocounting rectangles because I cannotiterate over elements here because thenit's a field forfirst for loop well it depends thoughcuz what if you you can pre-compute athe for a B right can't you canpre-compute all of the lines that gofrom eight you could recompute all thevectors a B yeah I can in N squared timebut then you have you pre compute themin N squared time oh but wait you thendo you have and no you don't have Nsquaredwhines then wait like I I can find themin n square and now I need to I thinkmodify in some way the deer map in someway feeling that if you have you you canpre-compute all the lines that go from apoint in the bottom left to the upperright in N squared time right you canpre-compute all the a B's in go thensquared and so then for every a be rightfor every a B and there they're there asmany a B's or fewer than the number ofpoints so they're there at most o of n aB's for every a B you can do your yourget vector a B your perpendicular thingright which is gonna be also o then soso for a B I'm writing really pseudocodefor a B do get perp and this is alsoit's like n n n wines a B that duneaction of oh then so n wines a B is itlike there can be N squared forceinstantly right well no because youwould you would have at most n lineslike you would have because we're onlydealing with wines at least maybe Imissed that thing from you but in mymind you only deal with lines that gofrom a bottom left point to an upperright point I meanwe can deal just with those where theboth x-coordinate increases andy-coordinate increases yeah notnecessarily 45 degrees but then stillpessimistic leader and square of themjust if you put a bunch of lines that goround along the line y is equal x oh yesand the words came in the worst casethere and squared yes yes in the worstcase so my guess for now is kind ofmaybe intuition is that yeah I want touse that but also to consider for ins Din some way so the deer map is not justthis from I think that this thing nowwould count the number of triangles withright angle and if I want this vein andif I want the number of rectangles sohow so to consider the v-beltiterating over C because I'm afraid thatwould be an Q unless maybe there is someamortized complexity going on then whenI create your map so from A to C I needto add this moment curves in some wayabout points D that are perpendicular toACthat is overwhelming well D do you doyou need to do you need to do that orcan't you just at the end at that atthat point just decide based oncoordinates you've collected where thatpoint D would be the thing is that hereright now my dear map only stores thecount rare in an emergency I could hearinside this dot append or push back inC++ C then here I would be able toiterate over matching point C but thenand Q yeahokay one more idea that it's kind oflike related to this normalization thingit's not maybe it's better to think fora moment about that previous count theone that solves the easier this is yourversion of a problem so iterate over allthe pairs say a B yeah and let's say Iwant to achieve the same thing thoughjust increase the counter for thosepairs there I had the counter for pair ycoordinate one y coordinate right justhere it's not a pair of Y coordinatesit's a vector let's say that that saysit from A to B you go two up and the totwo to the right and five upyeah you want to find marching withthose but also at the same the same likenot only matching vector because then ifa B and C the are same but in somedifferent positions you don't get arectangle weight so if you go with thatapproach if you go with your programlike the lines right what are the thereare only two conditions that you needlike the vector comes down to you needmatching lines of the same slope and youneed matching lines of the same lengthright sounds like I will get I will getwhat is called order of the legwork inPawleys let go good that parallelogrammore sighted think that has like bothpairs of sides are parallel to eachother yeah you will get parallelogramsas he tilted rectangle but I think Ihave a solution here so I will type thelike two sentences and then work withthat okay by the way just as a side notewe only have two minutes left so in theeffort okay keeping this you know easyfor every so for every vector a B I wantto normalize it in some way so I want toincrease the counter of the vector V andwhere Point a is with respect toperpendicular humvee I will explain thatin a moment and that normalize thinkwhat it should do it should thepseudo-code of that is let's say while aX is greater than 0 a - equal vector Ithink that does the job and now what Ihope it does is the zone Lyle functionyeah so this is a function that and thisis a pseudo code for that but also I cando a formula that is constant time andthis works assuming that like xcoordinates are positive what I mean isif you have a be like a segment that issomewhere what I want to do is I want topush it let's say somewhere around point0 0 if I is say free free and B is 3/7so this is like a vertical line by theway but I don't care about it from thatI want to normalize it so that I want toget this I want to shift shift it sothat this would be true so I will get 03 and 0 7 and then if I is for example10 free and B is 10 7 to normalize it tothis thing I will get the same stuff soby normalizing I first change every pairto such a normalized one and then Iclaim if two things gave me the samenormalized part they create a rectangleand this is extension of our firstversion of a problem I think rightwe're here I just shifted my vectorperpendicular to I B and here because Ihad vertical line what I did is Ishifted by horizontal line just to theleft yeah so I think that this gives usan square solution yeah this would beinteresting to code out well now we ranout of time so I think we were gonna andalso in an effort to keep this videocontained and you know to make a codinginterview we're gonna stop but thiswould be really interesting I wanted todo a very quick debrief with you Camilleso first of all great job I think thisis exhibiting this is a perfect exampleof a really the the kind of real codinginterview that you could get at acompany like Google and it's a perfectexample of a question that first of allis very difficult I think the first partof the question was very difficult andmost candidates would struggle throughthat first part during most of theinterview but here we were able to kindof or Camille rather was able to kind ofstretch the question and dive into apart of it that's just really reallydifficult and really knew where the youknow he's working to kind of try to finda solution the interviewer is notexpecting a perfect solution for thesecond part we're just kind of lookingto see how this candidate can can solvea problem or try to solve a problem soreally great job from that point of viewand also I want to say Camille yoursolution to the first problem I can'tfind it any more at this point but theone with the lines it's funny it'sactually different than the threesolutions that we have to this problemon our go expert we came up with threesolutions that are all three differentthan the NIR solution so that was kindof cool to see okay that's interesting Ifind it finally I find it funny by theway about the second version that atsample moments we were we just workedtogether with that because it was ainteresting hard problem I had you alsofor some moments like also tried maybethis works maybe this worked with thatone also the slope idea of course Ididn't investigate thatmuch yeah but it I think also helps thatinterviewer doesn't just watch but heshould give hints and also be some kindof sanity check help yeah I think ifI've said something very very stupidthere would be at least the question whyis that that noise I could go into thatdirection and waste half an hourdefinitely and I think it's for thesefor these kinds of problems that arehard again I think that this is aproblem even the first solution or thefirst version that is quite difficult itis gonna be expected that this is gonnabe kind of a problem that you're almostsolving with the interviewer you justhappen to be the person kind of leadingthe interview they're just there to kindof give you you know little hints hereand there but overall you're the oneleading it would be strange if it wasthe other way aroundof course but awesome that's that'sgonna be it I think for the for theinterview Camille any last thoughts onyour end I thank you for geometricproblem because then as I said I'm goodin geometry so I think now people willtreat me better than I am actuallybecause this is my area of interestit was problem was hard enough thesecond version ended in a lot ofproblems including the first versionit's just that I already knew problemthat is similar enough because I solvedthousands of problems my life and herethe second version maybe the middlepoint would work immediately I'm notsure now about it because I saw asimilar thing with that solution and itwas nice to investigate something forhalf an hour get some help from you andindeed show I guess how coding interviewshould look like yeah and I guess weshow you by the way just tear what youjust said about the first version thatif you practice enough and if you doenough of these problems you will beable to do even very difficult problemslike this one pretty easily like Camillejust said he had hadn't seen necessarilythis particular problem but he's seensimilarone similar patterns and so he was kindof able to nail it that's true and bythe way you don't need to self likethousands of problems because you don'tneed to solve a Google interview problemin seconds like to know a solution inseconds of course an interview of courseagain like here here I think you you didfantastically in the interviewespecially in the parts of likealgorithm and design and data structuresthese kinds of parts he really didfantastic but I I want to make it clearto the audience that you not have to dothis well in the algorithm and infinding a correct solution to pass theinterview in fact again for thisparticular problem for the first versionI probably wouldn't even expect thecandidate to code out a fully workingsolution so just to put things intoperspective that here you know Camilleis really performing super well but he'salso like a competitive programmer I'mkind of professional in solving problemsand the other people who practice is forI guess a few weeks that's such a bad atsubway image of describing yourself likeyou're a professional problem solveryeah that's a nice way to put it allright well that's gonna be it I thinkfor for the video thanks so much forbeing here Camille and if you enjoyedthis video make sure to give it a likeand to subscribe and also we filmedanother video on Camille's channel wherehe interviewed me not in a codinginterview but more kind of getting toknow me and asking me questions aboutyou know my math background and thesekinds of things so if you're interestedI'll put the link in the description andin the comments below be sure to showthem some love and I'll see you in thenext video
